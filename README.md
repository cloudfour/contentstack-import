# Contentstack import utility FORK

This is a fork of [contentstack/contentstack-import](https://github.com/contentstack/contentstack-import) which we've hacked to include a pre-processing script which converts an exported database dump into the structure/format compatible with Contentstack's import tool.

For import functionality, see [the original README](https://github.com/contentstack/contentstack-import/blob/master/README.md)...

## Usage

* `npm run prep` will read the files from source_data/ and write to output_data/
* `npm run test` will run the test suite

## Requirements

[x] Replace non-whitelisted authors with "Juice Staff"
[x] Map author usernames to auther entry (imports)
[x] Filter out articles NOT ( isActive && isPublished )
[x] Parse the string of category strings into individual items
[x] Map categories to category entries
[x] Gather image fields to match the Cloudinary fields
[x] Coerce SequenceId into int field
[x] Map image caption to `legacy_image_caption`
[x] Compile the URL field from various fields

## Import Sequence Checklist
1. Update `productionMode` variable in config.js
1. Run `npm run test` to make sure nothing broke
1. Run `npm run prep` to build new data files
1. Double-check that article reference fields point to NON *IMPORT versions
1. `npm run import`
1. Consider updating the references in CS to REMOVE *_import_testing options

NOTE: Lots of vague errors in the console are normal. Usual suspects:

```
error: Success file was not found at: /Users/emerson/Code/contentstack-import/_backup_841/mapper/entries/en-us/juice_article/success.json
```
```
error: Entry Uid: blt52843cdac9ead162 of Content Type: juice_article_import_testing failed to update in locale: en-us
error: {"error_message":"Entry update failed.","error_code":121,"errors":{"title":["is not unique."]}}
```

^ Neither of these appear to indicate that a problem actually happened.
