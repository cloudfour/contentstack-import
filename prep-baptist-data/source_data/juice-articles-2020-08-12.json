    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Having experienced months of inactivity due to COVID-19 restrictions, many student-athletes may be in a deconditioned state heading into the fall sports season.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why school districts are taking a phased approach when it comes to preseason activities, especially this time of year when heat issues and temperatures are at their highest.</p><p>&ldquo;August is one of the biggest months for exercise-induced heat illness and heat stroke, which is a medical emergency,&rdquo; said Jim Mackie, MEd, a licensed and certified athletic trainer and program development coordinator of the <a href=\"https://www.jaxsmp.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Sports Medicine Program</a>. &ldquo;Holding athletic practices in extreme heat requires constant monitoring and supervision.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2009, the National Athletic Trainers Association issued specific pre-season guidelines for adjusting to the heat, as part of its ongoing efforts to reduce the number of heat-related athletic injuries in secondary schools.</p><p>According to a 2019 survey, 18 cases of exertional heatstroke were reported at 10 Florida high schools during the 2017-2018 school year. Another 95 schools reported 461 cases of exertional heat illness that required treatment.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines heatstroke as a body temperature of 103 degrees or higher. Other heat-related illnesses include heat exhaustion and heat cramps.</p><p><strong>Zachary Martin Act</strong></p><p>Florida leads the nation in the number of heat-related deaths among student-athletes with four in the past nine years.</p><p>One of those fatalities was Zachary Martin, an aspiring high school football player from Fort Myers who collapsed during a preseason practice in June 2017. Martin died 11 days later, never regaining consciousness. He was only 16 years old.</p><p>According to medical research, there is a 100% survival rate if a person with heat stroke is immersed in ice-cold water within 10 minutes. Martin&rsquo;s high school had a cooling tub in its locker room but it was not properly prepared nor on the practice field at the time of his heatstroke.</p><p>In January 2018, the Florida High School Athletic Association&rsquo;s 15-person Sports Medicine Advisory Committee, which includes Robert &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; Sefcik, executive director of the Jacksonville Sports Medicine Program, recommended to the FHSAA board that all member schools have cold water immersion tubs.</p><p>But it took a bill created in the Florida Legislature, led by State Sen. Keith Perry of Gainesville, Laurie Giordano (Martin&rsquo;s mother) and Sefcik, to make cooling tubs mandatory, state-wide.</p><p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis recently signed the bill, known as the Zachary Martin Act, into law.</p><p>The act also requires FHSAA schools to train personnel year-round on heat-related illness symptoms and take actions to immediately treat athletes showing heat-stress symptoms, including cooling the body first before transporting the athlete to a nearby hospital.</p><p><strong>Special thermometer</strong></p><p>As part of the legislation, high schools are also required to record outside temperatures with a WetBulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) thermometer, which gives readings using several variables.</p><p>According to the National Weather Service, WBGT is a measure of heat stress in direct sunlight, which takes into account temperature; humidity; wind speed; sun angle; and cloud cover (solar radiation).</p><p>&ldquo;That differs from the heat index,&rdquo; said Mackie, an athletic trainer for more than 40 years and past president of the Southeast Athletic Trainers Association.</p><p>&ldquo;Outside temperatures have to be checked a half hour before each practice, re-checked periodically and schools must establish &lsquo;cool zones&rsquo; within the practice area.&rdquo;</p><p>Some modification of equipment worn, length of practice and rest breaks are based on the WBGT readings.</p><p><strong>30-minute threshold</strong></p><p>Once heat stroke is identified and the body has succumbed to the heat, getting an athlete in an ice tub is really the only way to guarantee survival, said Sefcik.</p><p>&ldquo;If we can get an athlete in a tub within 10 minutes, there&rsquo;s a 30-minute threshold during which the body can withstand that temperature,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After that, it becomes devastating and irreversible to the internal organs. On-site cooling is the best practice.&rdquo;</p><p>In August 2019, while providing care at a preseason football jamboree in Jacksonville, Sefcik, Mackie and other athletic trainers came to the aid of a cheerleader who passed out due to heatstroke.</p><p>The athletic trainers quickly placed the student-athlete in a cooling tub, which eventually brought her body back to a safe temperature.</p><p>&ldquo;Then we put her in a car with her mother and sent her home,&rdquo; Sefcik said.&nbsp;</p><p><em>To learn more about youth sports injury awareness, advocacy and prevention in Florida, visit<a href=\"http://jsmp.us\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;jsmp.us</a> or contact the <a href=\"https://www.jaxsmp.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Sports Medicine Program</a> at <a href=\"tel:1-904-202-4332\" target=\"_blank\">904.202.4332</a>.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Christopher Moise-Porras loves Legos, video games, Spiderman, Marvel comics and food &ndash; all kinds of food.</p><p>So, in the spring of 2019 when he started becoming picky, losing weight, and experiencing stomach pain, his parents grew concerned. On June 20, Christopher began vomiting and had difficulty walking. His parents rushed him to the ER at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;When I brought him in, I thought maybe he had appendicitis, not cancer,&rdquo; his mother Tania said. X-rays revealed a mass in her son&rsquo;s chest. That&rsquo;s when Christopher was diagnosed with Stage II Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma.</p><p><strong>Where faith and science meet</strong></p><p>For Christopher and his family, which includes parents Neil and Tania and little sister Francesca, their faith is paramount. As Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, they believe that a person&rsquo;s blood is sacred.</p><p>&ldquo;As a family, we thank God every day. We pray before we eat and go to sleep. It&rsquo;s a big part of our lives,&rdquo; said Neil. &ldquo;In our faith we respect blood as it is written in the Bible. Everyone&#39;s blood is like a unique fingerprint. We don&#39;t donate blood, we don&#39;t take blood into our bodies, and we have to rely on our beliefs and science, and our doctors as well.&rdquo;</p><p>When Christopher&rsquo;s doctors told his parents he would most likely need blood transfusions during his chemotherapy treatment to support his red blood cell counts, they did just that: they turned to prayer, then to science. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We spoke to the doctors about the different options, we prayed about it, and we asked for guidance. One of the lead doctors explained to me there was a Bloodless Medicine &amp; Surgery Program here in the hospital, and said they&rsquo;d do all they could to respect our wishes. We spoke to them and felt assured that, with their program, we would succeed.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>What is bloodless medicine?</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/bloodless-medicine\" target=\"_blank\">Bloodless Medicine &amp; Surgery Program</a> at Baptist Health and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital is the only one of its kind in Northeast Florida. Bloodless medicine involves using special techniques and therapies to safely and effectively treat patients without the use of donor blood products or transfusions. Some people seek out the program for religious reasons, like Christopher&rsquo;s family, while others may have had reactions to transfusions in the past or health conditions that make them ineligible to receive donor blood.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatric-hematologist-oncologist/dr-manisha-bansal-md\" target=\"_blank\">Manisha Bansal, MD</a>, board-certified pediatric hematologist/oncologist with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, led Christopher&rsquo;s care team. She said using bloodless medicine in a child&rsquo;s treatment is extremely rare.</p><p>&ldquo;In the 14 years I&rsquo;ve been here, this is the second time I&rsquo;ve had to use a truly bloodless medicine strategy in a cancer patient. It&rsquo;s difficult to predict in oncology when a child will need a blood transfusion. For one child, they may need a lot of transfusions, and for another, they may need far fewer.&rdquo;</p><p>Christopher&rsquo;s parents agreed to proceed with intensive chemotherapy over the course of four months with the intention of avoiding blood transfusions.</p><p><strong>A personalized plan in action</strong></p><p>After Christopher&rsquo;s first chemo treatment, his white blood cell count dropped to zero and his hemoglobin dropped to 7 g/dL, numbers that would typically require a blood transfusion. His parents searched for any way to support his immune system, ultimately working with the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital team to add as many iron-rich foods to his diet as possible. They blended beets, steak, sweet potatoes, watercress and more to use in his feeding tube. They made homemade teas to soothe his stomach and prevent mouth sores. And it helped.</p><p>&ldquo;We had maybe four to seven days right after chemo to pump his body up, and this helped exponentially increase his white blood cell counts,&rdquo; said Neil. &ldquo;Some of the doctors said he was nothing short of a miracle. To go from 0 to 5 overnight is simply unheard of. I think a lot of what we did for him in the days after receiving chemo helped his body recover better and not need the transfusion.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Between treatments, Christopher received a hormone to help stimulate his healthy red blood cells to recover faster, too.</p><p>&ldquo;In this situation, we were fortunate that the therapy was short enough and the disease type was such that I could modify the treatment slightly without sacrificing outcomes,&rdquo; said Dr. Bansal.</p><p><strong>Getting better together</strong></p><p>With his parents and doctors behind him, Christopher went through his chemotherapy without ever needing a blood transfusion. Today, at 8 years old, his dad says he&rsquo;s &ldquo;completely cured.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is perfectly healthy. He&#39;s undergone all kinds of follow-ups from the doctors,&rdquo; said Neil. &ldquo;He never needed blood. As parents, we&#39;re becoming a little more health-conscious. We&#39;re trying to make a better effort in that way.&rdquo;</p><p>While state-of-the-art cancer treatment is part of what saved Christopher&rsquo;s life, so is the bloodless medicine program, which incorporates patients&rsquo; and families&rsquo; wishes and uses leading-edge techniques to reduce the need for blood transfusion as much as possible. That support is what Neil remembers most about his son&rsquo;s care.</p><p>&ldquo;We feel very blessed that our son is alive today and will have a future,&rdquo; said Neil. &ldquo;We thank the doctors for allowing us to share a little bit of ourselves with them and having them respect our beliefs. That&rsquo;s the big point here: they respected us, and that is something we will forever be grateful for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bloodless medicine is really a team effort by the family and the provider,&rdquo; said Dr. Bansal. &ldquo;We both had the same goal, which was for Christopher to complete chemotherapy and treat this disease, and if I could accommodate their wishes, I was happy to do that as long as it was safe.&rdquo;</p><p><em>To learn more about the Bloodless Medicine &amp; Surgery Program at Baptist Health and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/bloodless-medicine\" target=\"_blank\"><em>baptistjax.com/bloodless</em></a><em>.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>On Memorial Day weekend, a group of friends headed to St. Augustine Beach to spend a relaxing day by the seashore.</p><p>One of the couples, who unfortunately had their wedding postponed due to COVID-19, wanted to bring the group together to honor the special day when they would have said their &ldquo;I dos.&rdquo;</p><p>The eight friends set up their beach camp beside two other couples and their children.</p><p>Among the four women in the group were Kelsey Genners, BSN, a pediatric nurse at <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>, and Leanna Swilley, BSN, an infusion therapy nurse at <a href=\"https://www.baptistmdanderson.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>.</p><p>Even though they have both worked for Baptist Health since 2017, Genners and Swilley hadn&rsquo;t met before that Saturday. They had just started talking about their respective nursing careers when a few of the men in their group pointed to a woman being pulled from the rough ocean.</p><p>The nurses realized that it was one of the women camped next to them on the beach.</p><p>A man had just rescued her from a dangerous rip current that had also caught the women&rsquo;s 14-year-old son and 12-year-old friend by surprise, according to a <em>First Coast News</em> report.</p><p>After the man carried the unconscious woman to shore, Genners and Swilley instinctively ran to her and immediately began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).</p><p>&ldquo;The victim&rsquo;s lips were blue and there was foam coming out of her mouth,&rdquo; Genners said.</p><p>Added Swilley: &ldquo;After seeing the color of her lips, we both went into &#39;nurse mode.&#39;&rdquo;</p><p>Swilley started doing chest compressions on the victim, which are essential to keeping oxygen-rich blood cells circulating. The nurses also turned the woman on her side to drain any excess water from her mouth and nose.</p><p>Swilley and Genners alternated doing chest compressions until rescue personnel arrived on the scene about five minutes later.</p><p>The nurses&rsquo; hearts continued to race as paramedics transported the woman to a nearby hospital for emergency treatment.</p><p>Following the incident, it was difficult for Genners and Swilley and the other members of their group to resume their beach day.</p><p>As they stared at the empty spot of sand where the woman&rsquo;s family had set up their beach camp, all the nurses could think of was whether the victim was going to be OK.</p><p>They found out two days later when they connected via Facebook with a friend of the woman they had saved. The friend was trying to identify the man who rescued her friend from the rip current and the nurses who had performed the critical, life-sustaining CPR that day.</p><p>The friend of the woman Swilley and Genners helped save told the TV station that &ldquo;doctors said it was the quality of the CPR that was done in those first few minutes that kept [the victim] from experiencing brain damage.&rdquo;</p><p>According to St. Johns County Fire Rescue, while en route to the hospital, the victim began breathing on her own and maintained a steady heartbeat. She spent less than 24 hours in ICU and was home with her family in three days.</p><p>&ldquo;That was amazing to hear and it makes my heart feel really great,&rdquo; said Genners, adding that the experience has made her appreciate the crisis preparedness training she does frequently at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;The mock codes we do once a month reinforce our training and help us to see how quickly we can switch into emergency mode.&rdquo;</p><p>Swilley said she was grateful to have a Baptist Health team member by her side that day.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel like nurses in a group of friends always gravitate toward each other,&rdquo; Swilley said. &ldquo;It was nice we were both there to help and support each other. In any situation like that, you need teamwork.&rdquo;</p><p>Talk about right place, right time. Swilley and her fianc&eacute;e had secured the last spot in a crowded parking lot that day. And the group of eight had just happened to be sitting right next to the victim&rsquo;s family when the emergency situation unfolded before their eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;God works in mysterious ways, and he definitely put us there for a reason,&rdquo; Swilley said.</p><p>In recognition of their heroic actions, Genners and Swilley received lifesaving medals and certificates from St. Johns County public safety agencies and Congressional Certificates of Merit from U.S. Rep. Michael Waltz. The nurses were also reunited with the woman whose life they saved and her friend during the heartfelt awards ceremony in early July.</p><p>In a statement to the news station, the victim said, &ldquo;I just want to thank those nurses from the bottom of my heart for reacting so quickly and never giving up on performing CPR. I was told by every team member at the ER and ICU that they saved my life.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you are interested in working as a nurse or in another field at Baptist Health, please visit <a href=\"http://baptistjax.com/about-us/careers\" target=\"_blank\">baptistjax.com/careers</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>As people have returned to bars in Jacksonville Beach and attending graduation parties, summer barbecues and even funerals, here and around the country, we&rsquo;re hearing more and more about &ldquo;superspreaders&rdquo; of COVID-19 in the news. And just like that old punchline, how is it that one infected person walks into a bar, and everyone inside walks out sick?</p><p><strong>What is a superspreader?</strong></p><p>First things first: you have to understand what it means to be a superspreader. The idea is that, once they&rsquo;re infected, some people&rsquo;s bodies just produce and shed more of the virus than others. The reason for that is unknown.</p><p>&ldquo;The virus replicates in some people more than others,&rdquo; explained <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/internal-medicine-hospitalist/dr-michelle-aquino-do\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle Aquino, DO</a>, a hospitalist at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville. &ldquo;We aren&#39;t sure why but they have increased concentrations of the virus in their system. When one of these individuals gets into the &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; situation &mdash; a closely packed crowd with lots of talking, on a bus, at a concert or a bar &mdash; the virus seems to spread more and higher numbers of people get infected.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Behavior or biology?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-infectious-disease-specialist/dr-mobeen-rathore-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mobeen Rathore, MD</a>, is chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease and Immunology for Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and co-director of the Baptist Health Infection Prevention and Control Committee. He says the word &ldquo;superspreader&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a scientifically accepted term, and b<a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/community-health/doing-our-part\" target=\"_blank\">ehavior may contribute to spreading infection just as much as biology</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;We have seen situations where somebody goes to church and the clergyperson and spouse unintentionally infected spread the virus to congregants, or situations like a big executive meeting where one individual may have infected 50 people, they become so-called superspreaders. But, I&rsquo;m not sure they&rsquo;re any different from others who are infected. It just so happens they&rsquo;ve infected a lot of people [based on the circumstances],&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m speaking loudly, and I&rsquo;m not wearing a mask, secretions from my respiratory tract will spread to others more easily. Or, if I&rsquo;m at a picnic and I&rsquo;m mingling, meeting others, hugging everybody &mdash; well, I&rsquo;m going to infect more people.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Who&rsquo;s most likely to superspread?</strong></p><p>An article in <em>The New York Times</em> stated that 10% of infected people are responsible for 80% of new infections. Dr. Rathore says those with a more severe case of COVID-19 are likely going to have a higher viral load &mdash; the amount of virus in your bodily fluids, like respiratory droplets &mdash; and make them more likely to become superspreaders. But asymptomatic folks who go about daily life, believing they aren&rsquo;t sick, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/community-health/assess-your-risk\" target=\"_blank\">could just as easily infect others</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;If you have a higher viral load, you will be shedding the virus at an increased rate. If somebody was asymptomatic, they might not spread it as much as someone with severe symptoms, but there&rsquo;s a chance for the virus to spread more because of opportunity,&rdquo; he said.</p><p><strong>Can you prevent superspreading?</strong></p><p>For Dr. Rathore and Dr. Aquino, superspreaders aren&rsquo;t as much of a concern as long as everyone does their part to keep themselves and each other healthy.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do everything we can to protect everyone from infection by staying home if you can, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/community-health/why-stand-6-apart\" target=\"_blank\">social distancing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/community-health/should-i-wear-a-mask\" target=\"_blank\">wearing masks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/community-health/dont-just-clean-disinfect-too\" target=\"_blank\">practicing hand hygiene</a>.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Many media outlets and medical experts have compared (and contrasted) the coronavirus to the flu virus. So, when it comes to warm weather, which Harvard University says helps keep the flu virus at bay during summer, can heat beat the virus that causes COVID-19 as well?</p><p>The reason for flu seasons is that the virus thrives in cooler, drier weather rather than in muggy, hot summer temps. As the world lives through its first summer with the newest coronavirus, doctors and researchers are watching closely to see how it reacts to the summertime highs, too.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-infectious-disease-specialist/dr-mobeen-rathore-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mobeen Rathore, MD</a>, is chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease and Immunology for Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and co-director of the Baptist Health Infection Prevention and Control Committee. While the scientific community doesn&rsquo;t have exact answers on how this novel coronavirus is responding to the heat, he says &ldquo;there is still hope&rdquo; that summer is on our side.</p><p>&ldquo;We know flu viruses go away, so it&rsquo;s possible that will happen with this one also,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is such a new virus that we know very little about it. So, we will all learn together. Unfortunately, we haven&rsquo;t maintained the same level of social distancing as we have in past months, so right now numbers are going up over the summer, not down. We don&rsquo;t know if the temperature has an effect on it. What we do know is that the virus needs hosts, so as long as people can get infected, it will continue to spread.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Rathore added that, had Florida&rsquo;s bars, restaurants and other businesses remained closed, there may have been an opportunity for the heat to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus. But as more precautions are lifted and large events are put back on the calendar, any chance the heat might have made a difference is quickly disappearing.</p><p>&ldquo;We know the other coronaviruses that cause infection in the winter usually wither away in the summer, and we were hoping this one would follow the same pattern,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Obviously, there&rsquo;s a huge concern with major events happening in Jacksonville because social distancing will be hard, and enforcing mask use would be nearly impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>When COVID-19 first came into the U.S., Dr. Rathore feels most people took the CDC-recommended precautions seriously. Now, he hopes some of these same individuals will not see the summer heat as a reason to relax on safety measures, no matter how much we all want to return to normal.</p><p>&ldquo;I think more people were cautionary about it before, but not so much at this time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That caution should stay, whether it&rsquo;s cold or hot, and you should be social distancing. Masking should continue. Don&rsquo;t go anywhere you don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p><p><em>At Baptist Health, we want to help keep our community informed about COVID-19.

She was busy getting everything ready at her home on Amelia Island, as moms are known to do, even when their children are all grown up.&nbsp;</p><p>The next thing she knew, she was lying on the kitchen floor. Haynam remembers seeing her sandal dangling off her foot and not being able to get it back on, no matter how hard she tried.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I wiggled across the tile until I made it to a chair, and somehow hoisted myself up to it,&rdquo; she said. When her son arrived, he found his mother sitting in the chair looking confused. His hello was greeted by silence; Haynam wasn&rsquo;t able to speak.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew my son was there,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t respond to him.&rdquo; Fortunately, he knew exactly what to do, and called 911 immediately.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Swift action</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Nassau County Fire and Rescue Department arrived in minutes to take her to Baptist Medical Center Nassau&rsquo;s Emergency Department. Her son and husband, Doug, followed.&nbsp;</p><p>When Haynam arrived at Baptist Nassau&rsquo;s ER, the medical team was ready and prepared to care for her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Debbie couldn&rsquo;t speak and didn&rsquo;t comprehend our questions,&rdquo; said Baptist Nassau emergency physician <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/emergency-medical-specialist-fasttrack/dr-annette-bell-md\">Annette Bell, MD,</a> who rushed Haynam immediately to the CT scanner to get images of her brain.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Bell was able to connect with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/interventional-neurologist/dr-amin-aghaebrahim-md\">Nima Aghaebrahim, MD,</a> an interventional neurologist at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/brain-and-spine/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-care\">Baptist Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular&nbsp;</a>Center in Jacksonville, through TeleStroke a virtual way to assess patients with stroke symptoms. He was able to see Haynam in real time and also immediately view her CT scans. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;There was an obvious blockage on the left side of her brain, cutting off the oxygen supply,&rdquo; said Dr. Aghaebrahim. &ldquo;I could see that she had weakness on her right side and difficulty speaking. The clot needed to be removed as quickly as possible.&quot; &nbsp;</p><p>Within minutes after Dr. Aghaebrahim confirmed her condition, Haynam was on the LifeFlight helicopter headed to downtown Jacksonville.&nbsp;</p><p>When she arrived, the entire stroke team at Baptist Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center was waiting, ready to spring into action. She was whisked into the operating room where Dr. Aghaebrahim began an emergency thrombectomy to save her life.&nbsp;</p><p>A thrombectomy is a procedure to remove a blood clot in an artery and restore blood flow along with oxygen back to the brain.</p><p>&ldquo;As we did with Debbie, thrombectomies are usually performed by going through the femoral artery in the groin and guiding a catheter up to the clot in the affected area in the brain,&rdquo; said Dr. Aghaebrahim. He was then able to apply suction to aspirate the clot.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Successful surgery</strong></p><p>&ldquo;When I woke up in the recovery room, I had no idea what had happened,&rdquo; Haynam said. &ldquo;They were asking me questions &ndash; what day it was, how old I am -- and I was able to answer them easily. My husband told me I had suffered a major stroke. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Stroke is the No. 1 cause of disability, and time is crucial when it comes to stroke. &nbsp;A person loses an estimated 1.9 million brain cells in the first minute of a stroke. Every minute a stroke goes untreated can mean an extra week of recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, many people are still delaying emergency care in light of COVID-19. Emergency department visits are down 42% across the U.S. due to COVID-19, according to the CDC. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;For Debbie, delaying care could have resulted in long-term or permanent disability on the right side of her body and problems with speech and language,&rdquo; said Dr. Aghaebrahim. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why calling 911 immediately is necessary if you notice stroke symptoms.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1595011618/Juice/NEURO_31335_BEFAST_Consumer_Card_v07.jpg\" alt=\"stroke symptoms\"></div><p>Baptist Stroke and Cerebrovascular Center&rsquo;s treatment times are faster than national averages to help ensure the best possible outcomes for our patients.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In Debbie&rsquo;s case, it was less than 90 minutes from the time she arrived at Baptist Nassau&rsquo;s ER until I began her procedure,&rdquo; Dr. Aghaebrahim said. This included transporting her by LifeFlight from Baptist Nassau to downtown Jacksonville.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Quick care played an important role in Debbie&rsquo;s recovery because restoring blood flow rapidly is the key to a good outcome when it comes to a stroke with a large vessel blockage,&rdquo; Dr. Aghaebrahim said.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This can only happen with great teamwork between Emergency Medical Services, our ER team members and our neurovascular team,&rdquo; he said. &rdquo;It&rsquo;s important to know that not all hospitals are equal when it comes to stroke treatment. At Baptist Health, we have protocols in place for rapid and effective care for patients like Debbie, along with excellent surgical and post-operative care.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A stroke can happen to anyone</strong></p><p>Haynam&rsquo;s friends and family were surprised she suffered a stroke; she is a healthy and active retiree who enjoys playing tennis, running and Jazzercise.</p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, a stroke can happen to anyone at any age. Debbie had atrial fibrillation, and at the time of her stroke, she was not taking blood thinners. So, despite her being otherwise healthy, she was at high risk for stroke,&rdquo; Dr. Aghaebrahim.</p><p>Dr. Bell said Haynam&rsquo;s situation is an example of excellent coordination between Nassau County Fire Rescue, Baptist Nassau (an Acute-Stroke-Ready Hospital) and Baptist Stroke and Cerebrovascular Center.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I feel really proud of the care that we as a team provided to her. I am grateful for the trust she and her family placed in us, and I am so happy that she is well again,&rdquo; Dr. Bell said.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In this time of COVID-19, we have taken great care to ensure that the ERs and other departments in our hospital are safe and equipped to provide safe and excellent care.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Road to recovery</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Haynam is relieved she has no disabilities resulting from her stroke, and is getting back to her normal activities &ndash; like walking her dogs, doing yard work and swimming. She hopes to return to the tennis court soon.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Make sure that people around you know the signs of a stroke and know to call 911 right away,&rdquo; Haynam said. &ldquo;My son knew what to do and he really saved my life.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/brain-and-spine/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-care\"><em>Stroke symptoms</em></a><em>&nbsp;include face drooping, arm weakness, difficulty with speech, sudden loss of balance or coordination, and sudden vision loss or double vision. </em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-emergency-rooms\"><em>Baptist Health ERs </em></a><em>have a separate area for patients who are experiencing stroke symptoms.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Being a new parent can be pretty overwhelming at times. It may feel like every peep or squeak your baby makes is the first sign of something serious. And while most rashes, upset tummies and yucky diapers are just part of raising a little one, there are certain signs and symptoms that should prompt parents with babies to head straight to the emergency room.</p><p>One unfortunate result of social distancing is that kids&rsquo; routine well care, and even emergency care, are being put off in fear of the virus. Just like routine well-child visits help keep your child healthy and track their development, emergency care can detect underlying issues you may not see with the naked eye after a fall, vomiting spell, or high fever. And with some symptoms, it&rsquo;s best <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/child-health/care-to-never-put-off\" target=\"_blank\">not to wait to seek care</a>.</p><p><strong>The fear with fevers</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-emergency-medicine-specialist/dr-daniel-thimann-md\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Thimann, MD</a>, is a board-certified pediatric emergency medicine specialist who practices at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Emergency Centers. When asked what parents should be worried about, he said their primary concern in their little ones is fever. It can be a sign of a complex condition that needs treatment right away.</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely, in babies two months old and younger or those who are not immunized, the recommendation would be to bring them to the ER for fevers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Infants are at increased risk of having fevers that are the sign of more complicated conditions than older kids or those who received their vaccines. Basically, if you vaccinated your child, you have protected them from more serious conditions. In immunized children with a fever, they typically have a virus or a UTI.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The doctor will see you now</strong></p><p>Other reasons Dr. Thimann would want to see your baby include:</p><ul><li>Animal bites or scratches</li><li>Falls, drops and other types of trauma</li><li>Hyperthermia (overheating)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/water-safety\" target=\"_blank\">Near-drowning</a></li><li>Skin rashes that cause your baby discomfort</li><li>Vomiting or diarrhea, especially if it has a red or black appearance</li></ul><p>&ldquo;We do see a fair share of babies who fall from beds, from the car, somebody holding them, counters or down the stairs, and the vast majority of these kids are going to be just fine, but you really need a professional opinion from a pediatric trauma expert to make sure your child is OK,&rdquo; said Dr. Thimann. &ldquo;If your child falls and hits their head, especially if they have a &lsquo;good egg,&rsquo; bring them to the ER. Chances are they&rsquo;ll be fine and we won&rsquo;t need to do anything, but we want to see that child.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Thimann added that vomiting and dehydration are serious concerns for infants. Skin rashes may also be a concern, but only if they seem to bother your little one.</p><p>&ldquo;With infants, persistent vomiting and inability to take in fluids are causes for concern. Abdominal pain is also very important for us to examine because it could indicate appendicitis, intussusception (intestinal obstruction) or malrotation (intestine is positioned incorrectly). Or it could be as simple as colic or milk protein allergy. Bleeding from the rectum in infants is not common, and it&rsquo;s always something that needs to be addressed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With skin rashes, our general train of thought is that if it doesn&rsquo;t bother the child, he or she is probably OK. If the rash bothers the child, that could be different.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>How urgent are these emergencies?</strong></p><p>Parents may wonder when it&rsquo;s best to take their child to the nearest pediatric ER versus calling 911. Dr. Thimann said, in most cases, taking your baby yourself is usually a perfectly safe option.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost always OK to bring your child by private vehicle, and may even be safer because you can strap them into their own car seat. However, if your child isn&rsquo;t acting like themselves, falls from a great height, or if you&rsquo;re concerned about your child receiving life-sustaining care, definitely call 911. It&rsquo;s never wrong to call the ambulance.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>But what about COVID-19?</strong></p><p>Of course, your baby getting sick during a global pandemic adds an extra layer of stress and concern. Is it better to manage his or her symptoms at home and not chance exposure to the virus? What is the most responsible thing to do?</p><p>&ldquo;Our hospital is very well prepared to care for COVID and non-COVID patients,&rdquo; said Dr. Thimann. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing everything we can to prevent the spread of disease and following all the CDC guidelines. If parental concern is there and you want to bring them into the ER, the last thing you have to worry about is the spread of COVID to your child. I feel very confident we can keep your kids safe.&rdquo;</p><p>Ultimately, Dr. Thimann urges parents to listen to their gut instinct. If you think your child may need to go to the ER, it&rsquo;s best to err on the side of caution.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for parents to know what to do because every child is so different, and you get advice from the grandparents, someone you know who is a nurse, or your sister, brother or friend. Just bring them in. We&rsquo;ll talk and make sure your child is OK.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If your baby is experiencing symptoms that are concerning to you, please take him or her to the nearest pediatric ER.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>In the early hours of March 26, 2020, Tommy Shapard found himself recording iPhone videos of himself saying his last goodbyes to his wife, Rachel, and his three children: Drew, Kate and Mac.</p><p>Shapard had come to the ER at Baptist Medical Center South only the day before, where doctors told him he&rsquo;d likely need to be put on a ventilator the next morning and wouldn&rsquo;t be able to speak. So, while his family slept at home, Tommy sent them all his love while he still had use of his voice.</p><p>The global pandemic seemed like exactly that &ndash; global, but not something that could ever happen to you. But when Shapard was diagnosed with COVID-19, things got personal.</p><p><strong>Allergies, or something more?</strong></p><p>&ldquo;It started out with sinusitis and allergy-like symptoms I normally get this time of year,&rdquo; Shapard said. &ldquo;I had a little cough. I have seasonal allergies and asthma so I always anticipate some things like that. In three days, all of that got worse.&rdquo;</p><p>On March 25 Shapard had a virtual visit with a nurse practitioner who urged him to head straight to the ER. She called ahead to Baptist Medical Center South to give them advance warning. <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/emergency-medical-specialist/dr-mary-zahn-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Zahn, MD</a>, an emergency medicine specialist, was waiting for him. <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/internal-medicine-hospitalist/dr-tamer-hassan-md\">Tamer Hassan, MD</a>, a hospitalist at Baptist South, would become involved in his care soon after.</p><p>&ldquo;The doctors were pretty much going to put me right on the ventilator in ICU,&rdquo; Shapard recalled.</p><p>It was late at night and his family was fast asleep, so he began recording videos of himself to send them instead, just in case he didn&rsquo;t make it. Physicians gave him treatments to try to delay the virus&rsquo;s effects. By morning, miraculously, his breathing was better.</p><p>&ldquo;The key was that treatment was started early so he improved significantly,&rdquo; said Dr. Hassan. &ldquo;On April 1, he was able to be discharged.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The road to recovery</strong></p><p>Shapard and his doctors have stayed in close contact, especially during the first six weeks after discharge, when the after-effects of COVID-19 are most severe. Dr. Hassan helped Shapard manage his nausea with real ginger[VAM3] [KM4] to spare his body any more medications, and the two worked on his diet to incorporate more foods high in vitamin C, zinc and probiotics. He also recommended Shapard do breathing exercises and walk 30 minutes to an hour a day as his breathing improved. This was a welcome activity for Shapard, who is a runner.</p><p>&ldquo;I was really sedentary for three weeks. The main issue was anxiety. Is the virus still in me or will it flare back up because there have been reports of some of that?&rdquo; said Shapard. &ldquo;My breathing was not quite right, and it&rsquo;s still not quite there, but it&rsquo;s a lot better now. One night I felt super good, and I turned to Rachel and said, &lsquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ve been walking but I wonder how far I could jog.&rsquo; I ended up running about a mile and a half and it felt really good.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Healing through helping</strong></p><p>An important part of Shapard&rsquo;s emotional recovery was donating his plasma, currently supported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a possible treatment for COVID-19 patients.</p><p>&ldquo;I discussed the plasma donation with Tommy and I walked him through the steps to get that done. His plasma already has antibodies that might save other peoples&rsquo; lives so when they take the plasma from his body, they might save two to three lives with that,&rdquo; explained Dr. Hassan. &ldquo;If we have mini-surges of COVID-19, having plasma could be very beneficial.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Once I heard about it, there was no question in my mind; I was going to do it,&rdquo; said Shapard. &ldquo;As I was giving plasma, the nurse told me my plasma was going to go immediately to a critical patient, and I was in tears just knowing a part of me that helped fight the virus was now going to be part of someone else to fight the virus. That felt redeeming in a way.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Learning together</strong></p><p>Today, Shapard is focusing on healing and learning as much about the coronavirus as possible. He speaks with Dr. Hassan and Dr. Zahn often so they can see how COVID-19 affects the body long-term.</p><p>&ldquo;Tommy was a special patient and he is close to my heart,&rdquo; said Dr. Hassan. &ldquo;Tommy is 44 and he was pretty sick, close to losing his life, but he recovered completely. It&rsquo;s very rewarding to see that. He asked great questions during hospitalization. He reads and researches. We are learning the recovery part of this virus together. No one knows everything about the virus, and what we&rsquo;re trying to do with Tommy is learn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m alive. It&rsquo;s still surreal to me,&rdquo; Shapard said. &ldquo;I want to emphasize how incredible the doctors, the nurses, administrators and everybody have been. The care and compassion weren&rsquo;t just medical care; you could tell they were concerned about the human side of it, too. I could tell they were concerned about my care, but also concerned about the virus and studying it, so to see that in action and to see them be very inquisitive about what&rsquo;s happening with me, it&rsquo;s amazing to be a part of that.&rdquo;</p><p><em>At Baptist Health, we want to help keep our community informed about COVID-19.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Last September, the Smith family of Moultrie was enjoying a Sunday outing at Wild Adventures theme park in Valdosta. Their family fun quickly ended when son, Rylan, 9, had a seizure and collapsed while at the bungee jumping attraction.</p><p>&ldquo;We were so worried about him,&rdquo; said Rylan&rsquo;s mom, Chantel Smith. &ldquo;Rylan is an active kid and constantly on the go, playing baseball, football and hip hop dancing. Normally, you can&rsquo;t stop him.&rdquo;</p><p>Rylan was taken to the ER at a local hospital, where doctors examined him. They monitored his vital signs and gave him fluids for dehydration before he was discharged home.</p><p>Four days later, a second incident occurred. Rylan, a third-grader at Odom Elementary School in Moultrie, collapsed again while at school. Rylan was taken to the ER at a different local hospital. Doctors ordered a CT scan and MRI, and the results were abnormal. Doctors recommended that Rylan be transferred to a children&rsquo;s hospital for specialty care.</p><p>&ldquo;As a nurse, I was familiar with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and I immediately knew that&rsquo;s where I wanted Rylan to go for care,&rdquo; said Chantel.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;World-class pediatric cardiology care</strong></p><p>Rylan was transferred by the Kids Kare Mobile ICU to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville, which provides specialized pediatric cardiac care for children in North Florida, South Georgia and beyond.</p><p>When they arrived, they were met by pediatric cardiac electrophysiologist Sunita Ferns, MD, and the medical team at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. Dr. Ferns is one of the few physicians in North America to be trained and board-certified in pediatric electrophysiology and adult congenital heart disease in addition to her board certifications in pediatrics and pediatric cardiology.</p><p>Dr. Ferns performed heart arrhythmia diagnostic testing after reviewing Rylan&rsquo;s medical history, family medical history and a physical examination. The testing included an electrocardiogram (EKG) and an epinephrine drug challenge to evaluate the electrical activity and the electrical pathways of Rylan&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>&ldquo;When I saw Rylan for the first time, what stood out was that he had experienced multiple episodes of near cardiac arrest, raising the possibility that something wasn&rsquo;t right,&rdquo; said Dr. Ferns.</p><p><strong>The diagnosis &ndash; Long Q-T syndrome</strong></p><p>After reviewing the results, Dr. Ferns diagnosed Rylan with Long Q-T syndrome, a rare heart disorder that can cause fast, chaotic heartbeats. With Long Q-T syndrome, the heart&rsquo;s electrical system takes longer than normal to recharge between beats. The defect causes a delay which can lead to fainting, seizures or even sudden death. Some people are born with a genetic mutation that causes Long Q-T syndrome, while others acquire the condition from certain medications, mineral imbalances or medical conditions. There is no known cure for the disease at this time.</p><p>&ldquo;It was an alarming diagnosis, but I was thankful because Dr. Ferns knew immediately what was wrong with my son,&rdquo; said Chantel.</p><p>Dr. Ferns prescribed a beta-blocker medication to help Rylan&rsquo;s heartbeat more slowly. He remained in Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Cardiovascular ICU for three days for observation and genetic testing.</p><p><strong>Life-saving monitoring and care</strong></p><p>Rylan returned to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital in October 2019. Dr. Ferns performed an outpatient procedure, inserting a small cardiac monitor under the skin in Rylan&rsquo;s chest. The monitor tracked his heart rhythm and wireless communications allowed data from the device to be transmitted real-time, around the clock, to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s for review by Dr. Ferns.</p><p>After monitoring Rylan&rsquo;s heart rhythm condition, Dr. Ferns recommended an automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD), a sophisticated device that is implanted in the body. The AICD works like a lifesaving pacemaker but can also detect dangerous heart rhythms and perform defibrillation, shocking the heart back to normal. The AICD monitors the heart via a wire that extends from the device and attaches to the inside of the heart. The AICD activity can then be monitored remotely by his doctors via a secure web-based satellite connection from any location in the world. Dr. Ferns surgically implanted the AICD in Rylan&rsquo;s chest at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital in December 2019.</p><p>&ldquo;The heart team at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s was wonderful,&rdquo; said Chantel. &ldquo;They answered all of my questions and kept me informed throughout Rylan&rsquo;s surgery.&rdquo;</p><p>Rylan continues to receive follow up care with Dr. Ferns at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. While he is restricted from playing competitive sports and has to limit contact sports, Rylan is able to enjoy most of his normal recreational activities. He will have to have the AICD battery replaced every 10 years.</p><p>&ldquo;I encourage all parents to follow their instincts when it comes to their child&rsquo;s health,&rdquo; said Dr. Ferns. &ldquo;Chantel knew something wasn&rsquo;t right with her son and sought out an expert opinion. In Rylan&rsquo;s case, it proved to be life-saving.&rdquo;</p><p><em>The Terry Heart Center at Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital provides life-saving pediatric cardiovascular care for children of all ages, along with adults born with heart defects.

A scuba diver turned his into a diving flag using red paper with a white diagonal stripe.&nbsp;</li><li>Carve out a studio in your home. If you have a designated place where you go to create, you&rsquo;ll be more committed. It makes your art feel more special and restorative.</li><li>Carry a sketchbook with you. This is a good way to be ready when inspiration strikes.</li><li>Repurpose unused items in your home and use them to create art. This is a great project to do with your kids, too. Find something that you were planning to recycle, and think of a way to turn it into an art project.</li><li>Find a group of people interested in the same type of artwork as you. Maybe you love to knit, and you can&rsquo;t meet with your knitting circle in person right now. Set up a Zoom meeting to discuss your latest projects and share tips. That&rsquo;s what Magee has been doing while the arts program is temporarily suspended.</li></ol><p>Normally, she sets up an art table in the lobby of Baptist MD Anderson every Wednesday and Thursday, coming up with themes for the art each month. For example, in February, during American Heart Month, patients made gratitude cards to say thank you to their caregivers or to anyone who has helped them along their cancer journey.</p><p>Patients also paint rocks with inspirational messages such as &ldquo;Hope&rdquo; or &ldquo;Just Keep Swimming&rdquo; that Magee places throughout the Cancer Center&rsquo;s garden. If a patient likes the message on a particular rock, they can have it. One patient who was going through breast cancer treatment picked up a rock that said &ldquo;Believe&rdquo; and held it in her pocket for two weeks. She said it empowered her to keep fighting.</p><p>&ldquo;Art helps these patients feel alive and whole,&rdquo; Magee said. &ldquo;It shows them they are not just another medical record number.&rdquo;</p><p><em>For more information about the support services available at Baptist MD Anderson, please&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistmdanderson.com/patients-and-families/support-services?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=juicce&utm_campaign=juice&utm_content=juice&utm_keyword=juice\" target=\"_blank\"><em>baptistmdanderson.com</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Over the past few months, life as we knew it has changed dramatically. We are all socially distancing by staying home more, postponing hair appointments, graduations and family gatherings, and telecommuting to work. Masks in public are now the norm, as is staying at least six feet apart. The ultimate purpose of these efforts is to help to keep as many people as possible healthy during the coronavirus pandemic by limiting the spread of the COVID-19 virus from person to person.</p><p>One unfortunate result of social distancing is that routine well care, especially for young children, is being postponed. Well-child visits during the first two years of life help parents and pediatricians track the child&rsquo;s growth and neurologic development at an age when they can&rsquo;t communicate with us. These visits are also an opportunity to vaccinate our youngest patients against certain bacteria and viruses that can make them extremely ill and even be fatal.</p><p>When babies are born, they have no natural immunity. By vaccinating them according to the <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/immunizations/Pages/Immunization-Schedule.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines</a>, we are able to protect them from diseases our ancestors feared, just as we currently fear COVID-19. The AAP recommends that well-child care should continue in person, especially during the first 24 months of life when we are vaccinating and building the child&rsquo;s immunity to easily transmitted diseases.</p><p>If we continue postponing vaccination appointments, our country risks the resurgence of pertussis, influenza B, meningitis, polio and more. Recent measles outbreaks in New York and Minnesota have shown us what can happen when even small groups of unimmunized patients come in contact with each other. Herd immunity, which is what we are trying to obtain with COVID-19, will be lost for all of these other diseases if too many children miss their well-child visits.</p><p>In order to protect our most vulnerable patients, many primary care offices are restricting in-office visits to well-child visits only, requiring that masks be worn by patients, parents and staff, and allowing only one parent to attend the visit in person. Rooms are now cleaned following newer, stricter infection control practices and are left unused for a longer period of time between patients. Cars have become the new waiting rooms, and you will receive a phone call when it&rsquo;s your child&rsquo;s turn to be seen.</p><p>As a mother of three, I understand the fear every parent has &mdash; that they may be doing the wrong thing for their child by bringing them to the doctor right now for their vaccines. But as a pediatrician, my goal is to advocate for children and provide them with the best medical care based on scientific evidence. I encourage all parents to contact their primary care offices and ask what they recommend, including what COVID-19 safeguards they have implemented. Our ultimate goal as pediatricians (many of whom are parents, too) is to provide safe care for our smallest patients and protecting them from the coronavirus and vaccine-preventable diseases.</p><div style=\"position: relative; display: block; max-width: 100%;\"><div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/4709052668001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6166951332001\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Our guest columnist is <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatrician/dr-bethany-atkins-md\" target=\"_blank\">Bethany Atkins, MD</a></em><em>, a board-certified pediatrician with&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-pediatrics\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Pediatrics</em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</em></a><em>.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>If you&rsquo;re a runner like I am, you have most likely heard that running can be bad for your knees, hips and joints. It&rsquo;s a warning I&rsquo;ve never wanted to hear. To me, running is a fun exercise. It&rsquo;s a time to collect my thoughts, decompress and get a cardio workout. However, as I get older, I&rsquo;ve started thinking more about wear and tear on my body. Am I really damaging my joints by running?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/orthopedic-surgeon/dr-brett-frykberg-md\" target=\"_blank\">Brett Frykberg</a>, MD, an orthopedic surgeon with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/jacksonville-orthopaedic-institute\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</a> (JOI), said that running or any type of exercise is not only good, but necessary for healthy joints. As a former track and field athlete at the University of Tennessee, Dr. Frykberg knows all about the importance of exercising. In late 2019, he completed a full Ironman in Australia and was training to do multiple half-triathlons before COVID-19.</p><p>A good friend and former teammate of Dr. Frykberg&rsquo;s was complaining of knee pain. He was a world-class runner who had logged more than 30,000 miles. He was expecting to hear that he would need knee replacements. However, when the X-rays came back, his knees were perfect &mdash;some of the best Dr. Frykberg had seen.</p><p>&ldquo;Movement is everything,&rdquo; said Dr. Frykberg. &ldquo;Exercising on a daily basis, whether it&rsquo;s walking, swimming, running or cycling, helps you maintain a healthy weight and causes your body to create hyaluronic acid, which acts as a lubricant for your joints and bones. Think of it like motor oil in a car. It improves the overall function of your body.&rdquo;</p><p>If you are too sedentary, your body will not produce enough hyaluronic acid, which can result in friction in your joints and damage your knees and hips more than normal when you decide to begin an exercise program. If you aren&rsquo;t exercising daily, Dr. Frykberg suggests starting out slowly and building up as you get in better shape to avoid injury.</p><p>&ldquo;If you feel pain, take a few days to recover. Don&rsquo;t continue to exercise or fight through the pain because it could get worse,&rdquo; said Dr. Frykberg. &ldquo;If you are experiencing pain, you should ice the injury, gently stretch, massage that area and elevate it.&rdquo;</p><p>My knees, hips and joints &nbsp;haven&rsquo;t yet logged 30,000 miles, but now I am not afraid to try to get there knowing that movement and exercise can improve my joints, muscles and bones. Just like Forrest Gump, I&rsquo;m going to keep running.</p><p><em>Specially trained physicians at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/jacksonville-orthopaedic-institute\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</a> provide comprehensive care for muscles, bones and joints.

We were married two years later,&rdquo; said Laura Schuck.</p><p>Three years ago, Carl Schuck, 72, was diagnosed with lung cancer. He underwent robotic-assisted lung surgery at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a> and has been cancer-free ever since.</p><p>&ldquo;I just marked my third year of survivor status,&rdquo; said Schuck, who stays in &ldquo;reasonably good shape&rdquo; by working out several times a week at his local fitness center.</p><p>So, when his muscles became unusually tired in mid-March, Schuck wondered if he was coming down with something.</p><p>&ldquo;I had no energy and no appetite whatsoever, and that persisted for a few days,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>When he developed a fever of more than 100 degrees, Laura Schuck could see the writing on the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;When he wouldn&rsquo;t eat, that&rsquo;s when I became concerned that Carl had contracted the coronavirus,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And with his weakened immune system, we decided it was time to take him to the hospital.&rdquo;</p><p>Schuck was so feeble on March 20 he had to be wheeled into the Emergency Center at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-south\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center South</a>.</p><p>A CT scan of his chest detected he had COVID-19. It wasn&rsquo;t long before he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.</p><p>&ldquo;That was the last time I saw him until I picked him up from the hospital on April 10,&rdquo; Laura Schuck said.</p><p><strong>&lsquo;One of their worst COVID cases&rsquo;</strong></p><p>Laura Schuck said she received detailed updates on her husband&rsquo;s condition every day while he was an ICU patient at Baptist South.</p><p>&ldquo;At one point, he came down with pneumonia because of all the moisture in his lungs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;One of the nurse practitioners would typically speak with me after rounds. One called me like clockwork. You would have thought he had all day just to speak with me. He was very reassuring and told me how brave Carl was.&rdquo;</p><p>After two weeks on a ventilator, Schuck started to rally and breathe on his own and was slowly brought out of sedation.</p><p>&ldquo;That was a sign that he was really fighting this,&rdquo; said Laura Schuck.</p><p>Three days after being taken off a ventilator, Schuck said he came out of his &ldquo;brain fog.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t always the best patient,&rdquo; he joked. &ldquo;I started pulling tubes out because I was having hallucinations. Every time I woke up, I thought I was in a different room. For some reason, I thought they were moving me all around the hospital.&rdquo;</p><p>Schuck knew he had turned the corner when he was allowed to eat and drink again.</p><p>&ldquo;The first thing they brought me was two cans of ginger ale and I drank them both,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My first real meal was a sandwich and I was thrilled when they brought me my first salad. After that, I ate everything in sight.&rdquo;</p><p>During his 21-day hospital stay, Schuck lost around 20 pounds. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recommend that diet,&rdquo; Laura Schuck said.</p><p>&ldquo;As he got stronger, he started using his cell phone to answer emails and Facebook posts. One of his doctors told me that Carl was one of their worst COVID cases, but he bounced back and responded so well to their treatment.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Gauntlet of caregivers</strong></p><p>When he was discharged from the hospital on Good Friday, April 10, a gauntlet of Baptist South team members, many dressed in green scrubs and personal protective equipment, lined a first-floor hallway to bid him a fond farewell.</p><p>&ldquo;I was so overwhelmed with emotion. I had no idea that was going to happen,&rdquo; Schuck said. &ldquo;Everyone, from the doctors to the respiratory therapists, took such good care of me. I called all the nurses my &lsquo;angels of mercy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Schuck said he felt like &ldquo;a wilted piece of lettuce&rdquo; when he finally arrived back at his Ponte Vedra home.</p><p>&ldquo;I was so wiped out. It was all I could do to get from the car to my bed that afternoon,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But the next day was Holy Saturday and I was determined to watch the entire vigil mass on TV.</p><p>&ldquo;Our faith is what pulled us through all of this.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Four-year-old, happy-go-lucky Lucy Rose Donmoyer likes Swedish Fish candy and pull-and-peel cherry TWIZZLERS. She loves the Muppet fairy Abby Cadabby on &ldquo;Sesame Street&rdquo; and the movies &ldquo;Frozen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Trolls.&rdquo; She loves her baby sister Charlotte, mom Jessica and dad Jordan, and her grandparents in Florida.</p><p>Back in February, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Northeast Florida, Jessica noticed Lucy wasn&rsquo;t her usual bubbly self and seemed to be constantly fighting a fever. She took her little girl to her pediatrician and to the ER several times. Through exams and multiple rounds of bloodwork, doctors ruled out the &ldquo;usual suspects&rdquo;: flu, pneumonia or a urinary tract infection. When bloodwork revealed Lucy was anemic for a second time, her doctor referred her for a hematology consult at Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville.</p><p>&ldquo;Between the bloodwork and follow-up care with her pediatrician, Lucy began complaining that her back and hip were hurting,&rdquo; Jessica remembered. &ldquo;We had a virtual appointment with <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-hematologist-oncologist/dr-cynthia-gauger-md\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. [Cynthia] Gauger</a> [a pediatric hematologist/oncologist with Nemours and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital] on April 13. Dr. Gauger said she wanted us to come in so they could look at her and &lsquo;put hands on her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>That Thursday, April 16, Jessica brought Lucy into Nemours for an appointment with pediatric hematologist/oncologist <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-hematologist-oncologist/dr-manisha-bansal-md\" target=\"_blank\">Manisha Bansal, MD</a>. &ldquo;Dr. Gauger&rsquo;s concern from the labwork was that it wasn&rsquo;t straightforward anemia,&rdquo; said Dr. Bansal. &ldquo;When I saw Lucy, she looked like she wasn&rsquo;t well and she had a distended belly. On physical examination, I could feel a large mass in her abdomen.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Bansal ordered an ultrasound and a chest X-ray to be performed the next day. &ldquo;The pediatric radiologist at Nemours called me right away,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was already pretty sure it was an aggressive (high-risk) neuroblastoma.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was by myself with Lucy, watching &lsquo;Frozen&rsquo; in the ultrasound room when Dr. Bansal called me,&rdquo; remembered Jessica. &ldquo;She said we could go home because they knew what was going on. She explained that Lucy had a large mass behind her stomach and asked when she could talk to my husband and me together once we were home. Lucy asked why I was crying and I said, &lsquo;I am just emotional.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Bansal called Jordan and Jessica within an hour. &ldquo;She told us what she thought the mass was and explained the process of doing tests to figure out what kind of tumor it was and how big it was. She told us Lucy would be admitted on Monday. That weekend was when I started telling my family and close friends what was happening.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Bansal admitted Lucy to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital on April 20, ordered a CT scan on Tuesday, and a biopsy of the mass on Wednesday to confirm the diagnosis of high-risk neuroblastoma.</p><p><strong>A heart and a rose for Lucy Rose</strong></p><p>The day Lucy was admitted, her grandfather Scott Jernigan and his girlfriend Tangela Andrews drove from Tallahassee to be nearer Jessica and Lucy.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Heart Sign Wolfson\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1591710395/Juice/Ketterman_200514_07066-web.jpg\"></div><p>Due to restricted COVID-19 visitation at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, only Jessica was able to be with Lucy. To make sure her father knew which room they were in, Jessica made a heart sign in the window. The next day, Jernigan went to the store to buy supplies to make a giant heart sign for the top of the parking garage to let Jessica and Lucy know he was there for them.</p><p>Jernigan said &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand my daughter and granddaughter doing this alone. I wanted to be as close to them as I could and that was the closest I could get. I wanted them to know we love them and are thinking of them. Lucy came to the window every morning to look at the sign and know Tangela and I were there. It meant a lot to my daughter, too.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Aggressive treatment for an aggressive tumor</strong></p><p>On April 24, Lucy began his first round of high-intensity chemotherapy.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-hematologist-oncologist/dr-howard-katzenstein-md\" target=\"_blank\">Howard Katzenstein, MD</a>, chief of hematology/oncology at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s and Nemours, was Lucy&rsquo;s primary physician during her stay. He is published on the diagnosis and treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma.</p><p>Jessica remembered: &ldquo;Dr. K said Lucy&rsquo;s neuroblastoma is one of the largest he&rsquo;d ever seen but he said the treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma is the same, small or large, whether it spreads through the body or not: five cycles of high-intensity chemo, possibly surgery to remove it, a stem-cell transplant, radiation and immunotherapy. It&rsquo;s a 1-1/2 year process. But Lucy&rsquo;s a trooper and handled her first two waves of chemo treatment well.&rdquo;</p><p>While it&rsquo;s too early to tell how Lucy&rsquo;s cancer will respond to treatment, she is preparing for her third cycle of chemotherapy, along with a stem cell transplant this summer.</p><p>Jessica, who was raised since she was a baby by single father Jernigan in Tallahassee, said the hardships she has faced in her life have helped her stay strong for Lucy. &ldquo;Everything I&rsquo;ve gone through in my life has prepared me for this, to be Lucy&rsquo;s mom and to be strong. It has been hard being in the hospital with Lucy without my husband for 10 days at a time due to COVID-19 but I have just buckled up. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what&rsquo;s happening, we&rsquo;re going to do whatever we have to do.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Lucy Family\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1591710394/Juice/IMG_4153.jpg\"></div><p>Jessica said she and Jordan are so grateful for the tremendous support they&rsquo;ve received from the caregivers at Nemours and at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Friends and family from Tallahassee and Jacksonville, our neighbors, Lucy&rsquo;s preschool teachers, the nurses and Child Life specialist on 4 Weaver at Wolfson, and the caregivers from Nemours have helped us get through this,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>In fact, the Donmoyers&rsquo; neighbors, along with JSO officers, Jacksonville Fire Rescue, teachers, classmates and others held a parade in front of their East Arlington neighborhood after Lucy was discharged from Wolfson the first time.</p><p>&ldquo;It was amazing!&rdquo; she recalled.</p><p>Jessica said the support has meant the world to Lucy Rose. &quot;My daughter has been amazingly strong through this whole thing,&rdquo; said Jessica.</p><p>Dr. Bansal agrees. &ldquo;Lucy&rsquo;s handling treatment extremely well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It limits her physically but she is able to do most of what she wants to do. She has a really great family support system.&rdquo;</p><p>She added, &ldquo;Because high-risk neuroblastoma is aggressive and difficult to treat, we&rsquo;re going to continue to max out each of our treatment modalities to give her the best chance to survive.&rdquo;</p><p><em>When a child is diagnosed with cancer, moms and dads want answers, and the best care available.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>After five years of dealing with shoulder pain, Nancy Mann, a classically trained pianist, thought she&rsquo;d never get to play her music again.</p><p>The pain began after she fell out of a pose in yoga class. After the fall, she had stiffness and pain in her right shoulder and was diagnosed with a frozen shoulder.</p><p>Weeks of physical therapy didn&rsquo;t help, so Mann went to an orthopedic surgeon, who determined she had a torn labrum. The labrum is rubbery tissue that creates a cuplike shape known as the shoulder socket. When it tears, it makes it impossible to have a normal range of motion. Mann had labrum repair surgery and thought she was on the road to recovery.</p><p>&ldquo;I was going gangbusters in physical therapy,&rdquo; Mann said, &ldquo;And then all of a sudden, I couldn&rsquo;t move it. At times, I had to have my husband cut my food for me. Even walking was painful.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Hope for a remedy</strong></p><p>Mann&rsquo;s orthopaedic surgeon in her hometown of Savannah, Ga., recommended she see <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/orthopedic-surgeon/dr-bruce-steinberg-md\">Bruce Steinberg, MD,</a> an orthopedic surgeon with <a href=\"https://www.joionline.net/jacksonvilleorthopaedics/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1a6Sn8Lr6QIVqNSzCh208wcwEAAYASAAEgJ79fD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</a>. Dr. Steinberg knew Mann needed a total shoulder replacement, but severe osteoporosis had deteriorated her glenoid, the area where the shoulder socket attaches.</p><p>A total shoulder replacement involves removing portions of the shoulder joint and replacing them with artificial implants. &ldquo;The osteoporosis in Nancy&rsquo;s shoulder was so severe that there was nothing to connect the implant to,&rdquo; said Dr. Steinberg.</p><p>Mann&rsquo;s pain had escalated to an 8 or 9 on a scale of 10 and her quality of life was suffering.</p><p>She especially missed the piano, which she played at her church and taught for 30 years. &ldquo;I love to play and consider it my ministry. It brings so much joy to me and to the people I play for, giving them some solace in tough times,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><strong>In search of the best approach</strong></p><p>Dr. Steinberg was determined to find a solution for Mann. &ldquo;I researched options for several months and finally determined that a new technology that could make up for the severe loss of bone by making a custom-made 3D titanium implant.&rdquo;</p><p>Called the Signature &trade; Glenoid Shoulder System, the implant is made based on CT imaging of the patient&rsquo;s shoulder and is 3D-printed to match the patient&rsquo;s exact anatomy to fill in the missing bone perfectly. The computer-assisted system enables the surgeon to determine the right length and trajectory of the screws that attach the implant to the patient&rsquo;s natural anatomy. The shoulder joint can then be attached to the implant so the shoulder functions more normally.</p><p>&ldquo;Without this technology, Nancy would still be in pain with very limited activities. The fact that the implant is custom-made provides a natural fit with a good range of motion,&rdquo; Dr. Steinberg said.</p><p>The procedure took Dr. Steinberg about three hours and Mann stayed in the hospital for just two nights. &ldquo;After 16 weeks of physical therapy, Nancy felt significantly better and was able to return to the activities she loves,&rdquo; Dr. Steinberg said.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a life now,&rdquo; Mann said. She&rsquo;s playing with her young grandchildren again, even going down slides at the local playground. &ldquo;I walk about three miles a day and soon, I&rsquo;ll get back to water aerobics.&rdquo;</p><p>Most rewarding, she&rsquo;s back to playing the piano and enjoys being a bright spot for her listeners. &ldquo;Dr. Steinberg restored my life,&rdquo; said Mann. &ldquo;Being able to play the piano again has given me back my purpose.&rdquo;</p><p><em>For an appointment at JOI, call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"tel:1-904-564-2000\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.564.2000</em></a><em>&nbsp;or vi</em><em>sit <a href=\"https://www.joionline.net/jacksonvilleorthopaedics/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1a6Sn8Lr6QIVqNSzCh208wcwEAAYASAAEgJ79fD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</a></em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>With most of the country re-opening after COVID-19, there have been questions about proper hygiene and disinfecting personal products and public spaces. &nbsp;</p><p>Aleya Byrd, RN, an infection preventionist at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, said the virus that causes COVID-19 is believed to be easily killed through everyday cleaning and disinfection products, like Clorox&reg; or Lysol&reg; wipes. As an infection preventionist, Byrd makes sure that health care workers and patients take the right precautions to prevent infections at Baptist Health.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a difference between cleaning and disinfecting. Cleaning is simply removing anything you can visibly see, such as crumbs or a coffee ring. Disinfecting requires using a product to kill germs. These products have a &lsquo;wet&rsquo; or &lsquo;contact&rsquo; time, which is the time it takes to kill germs. The surface needs to be visibly wet for the set period of time to kill the germs,&rdquo; said Byrd.</p><p>What should your own personal hygiene and disinfecting look like to help limit the spread of COVID-19 after going to work, leaving the grocery store, working out at the gym, or dining at a restaurant?</p><p>The simple answer is all based on personal comfort, and how you have interacted when you are out. However, you can decrease your risk greatly with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/community-health/video-washing-your-hands\" target=\"_blank\">proper hand hygiene</a>.</p><p><strong>At the gym</strong></p><ul><li>Take your own water bottle.</li><li>Clean and disinfect the weights and equipment prior to and after your use.</li><li>Use your own towel.</li><li>Wash your hands after using the equipment.</li></ul><p><strong>At the grocery store</strong></p><ul><li>Disinfect your shopping cart.</li><li>Practice social distancing.</li><li>Wear a mask.</li><li>Rinse fruit and vegetables once you return home.</li><li>Clean and disinfect your countertops after placing grocery bags on them.</li><li>Perform hand hygiene after leaving the store.</li></ul><p>Here are some other reminders to practice self-hygiene and disinfection to limit the spread of COVID-19:</p><ul><li><strong>Wash your hands regularly</strong> especially before you eat, after coming in contact with high-touch points and surfaces that are touched frequently throughout the day, such as: door handles, tables, toilet handles, electronic devices (laptop, mouse, keyboard, TV remote, cell phone) and light switches.</li><li>Wear a face covering. Place your mask in a paper bag to limit the exposure to outside elements and the number of times you touch the mask. Wash your face covering after each use, and make sure it is completely dry before re-using. If you notice the structure of the mask is deteriorating, it is time for a new mask.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/community-health/why-stand-6-apart\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Continue social distancing practices</strong></a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/community-health/which-surfaces-should-you-disinfect\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Disinfect surfaces</strong></a> that people frequently touch, such as countertops and door handles&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Keep your fingernails short and natural</strong>.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Aisle 9 has been empty for quite some time. As soon as COVID-19 hit the United States, shoppers rushed to stores to pick up disinfectants, wipes and hand sanitizer (oh, and toilet paper). As the shelves have been restocked, it&rsquo;s still difficult to find those prized disinfectant wipes.</p><p>So, how do hospitals maintain frequent cleaning when it appears cleaning supplies are in short supply?</p><p>&ldquo;Finding consumer products and hospital-grade products are two entirely different worlds,&rdquo; explained Maxine Shoemaker, a financial analyst for Strategic Sourcing at Baptist Health. &ldquo;Hospitals have access to national health care suppliers and can find hospital-grade cleaning and disinfecting products that are manufactured by companies that are different than those consumers are used to seeing in stores.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>No stone unturned&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There are also safeguards in place to manage the allocation of supplies to hospitals in emergency situations such as COVID-19. This ensures hospitals have the cleaning and disinfecting supplies it needs to care for its patients, families and staff.</p><p>&ldquo;Though we feel secure with the allocation of products from major distributors, our Strategic Sourcing team has been creative during this time in building up our reserve supplies,&rdquo; &nbsp;said Shoemaker. &ldquo;We did a generous amount of research to find new sources and vet leads for the cleaning and disinfecting products we use here at Baptist Health. We began sourcing from suppliers whose distribution to other businesses, like gyms and dental offices, had slowed down due to closures or reduced operating hours.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>7 steps to extra-clean</strong></p><p>Not only are health system supplies purchased in bundles, the cleaning processes and supplies are also part of a bundle to ensure research-based practices are followed consistently in cleaning every setting. Baptist Health utilizes the practices and training from Sodexo, a company whose programs are used in over 3,000 hospitals globally.</p><p>&ldquo;We use very specific products that are primarily used in health care settings,&rdquo; explained Andi Nurcellari, director of Environmental Services at Baptist Health. &ldquo;Even though you can&rsquo;t find wipes in retail stores, we still use our Oxivir (similar to bleach) wipes and Defender ES System (chlorine-based) wipes in our facilities. These are single-use wipes that kill pathogens, or organisms that cause disease, within one minute.&rdquo;</p><p>He also credits the increased use of the Xenex&reg; LightStrike &trade; germ-zapping robots for extra patient protection. For the rooms of patients being treated for COVID-19, the robot is used before the Environmental Services team enters the room to clean, and is used again when cleaning is complete.</p><p>&ldquo;To ensure every surface in a room has been inspected during the cleaning process, we use a widely adopted, seven-step cleaning process,&rdquo; said Nurcellari. The procedure includes:</p><ol><li>Removing trash and replacing bed linen</li><li>Dusting in the highest areas</li><li>Wiping surfaces with a disinfectant solution</li><li>Cleaning the restroom</li><li>Dust-mopping the floors</li><li>Damp-mopping the floors</li><li>Thoroughly inspecting the room</li></ol><p>Team members who clean in health care settings have frequent training on these steps.</p><p>&ldquo;We have weekly huddles and monthly training with all of our team members, on all shifts,&rdquo; said Nurcellari.</p><p>Even if you don&rsquo;t see Lysol&reg; or Clorox&reg; wipes at the store for weeks to come, hospitals have unique access to the supplies needed to disinfect and protect you and your loved ones.</p><p><em>Baptist Health is known for quality and safety.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>If your child has ever complained of his legs throbbing at night, he may be experiencing growing pains. Many children go through these pains as they get bigger, but how do you know when something more serious is going on in their growing bodies?</p><p><strong>Getting bigger is a pain</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-rheumatologist/dr-jennifer-rammel-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Rammel, MD</a>, a pediatric rheumatologist with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville, explained that growing pains tend to happen at certain ages for nearly half of all kids.</p><p>&ldquo;Growing pains are intermittent, benign musculoskeletal pain, and they can happen in up to 40% of children. I&rsquo;ve had experience with growing pains both as a physician and as a mom to a toddler,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They most commonly occur during the peak of growth in the 3- to 5-year-old range, and again at ages 8 through 12, right before puberty. They typically cause leg pain in both legs in the shins, thighs or behind the knees. The pain typically presents in the evening time and it can be worse on days where there&rsquo;s more activity.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Could it be chronic?</strong></p><p>While growing pains may just be part of growing up, persistent joint pain or rheumatologic issues aren&rsquo;t normal for children. How can you tell if your child is experiencing something more serious?</p><p>Red flags include:</p><ul><li>Severe, persistent pain</li><li>Limping</li><li>Pain that wakes them in the middle of the night</li><li>Joint swelling, fever, rash or weight loss</li></ul><p>Additionally, if the growing pains never really go away, it may be time to have your child evaluated for other possible joint conditions.</p><p>&ldquo;Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common autoimmune disease I care for as a pediatric rheumatologist,&rdquo; Dr. Rammel said. &ldquo;JIA can begin at any age from toddlerhood up, and typically presents with joint swelling that stays there for more than three days, stiffness in the mornings or after naps, and persistent limping or pain.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Rammel explained that every person has about a 1% risk of developing an autoimmune disease, regardless of their health or family history. Children with a family history of autoimmune conditions have about a 5% chance of developing one, too, so it&rsquo;s important to know your family history can impact your child&rsquo;s joint health.</p><p><strong>The downside of being double-jointed</strong></p><p>Children can also experience chronic joint pain if their joints are hypermobile, commonly known as being double-jointed (about 10% of the population has this trait). In fact, pain from hypermobile joints is the symptom most commonly confused with growing pains.</p><p>&ldquo;This confusion doesn&rsquo;t happen as much with JIA since there&rsquo;s swelling, stiffness and limping, but patients with joint hypermobility often get told over and over that it&rsquo;s just growing pains,&rdquo; said Dr. Rammel. &ldquo;There can be overlap between the two and hypermobility can make growing pains worse, but if it&rsquo;s happening outside the usual age ranges where growing pains are common and is persistent, it&rsquo;s something to consult your doctor about.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Finding answers</strong></p><p>If your child is experiencing chronic joint pain or has any of the red flags mentioned above, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have them examined by their pediatrician, who may refer you to a pediatric rheumatologist. Learning about the cause of your child&rsquo;s joint pain can help you manage symptoms and prevent damage in the long term.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re ever unsure, we&rsquo;re always happy to evaluate your child,&rdquo; said Dr. Rammel.</p><p><em>If your child is experiencing persistent joint pain or stiffness, call <a href=\"tel:1-904-633-0920\" target=\"_blank\">904.633.0920</a> to make an appointment with a pediatric rheumatologist.</em></p>",

All I knew was that my head hurt, and I couldn&rsquo;t look at a light or have any noise near me. If I had either of those things, my head began throbbing.</p><p>It turns out I suffer from episodic or acute migraines, which typically happen a few times a month or less. Chronic migraines occur much more often, about 15 or more days a month.</p><p>&nbsp;I spoke with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurologist/dr-nitin-butala-md\">Nitin Butala</a>, MD, a neurologist with Baptist Neurology, to learn more about this often debilitating condition.</p><p><strong>What is a migraine?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&ldquo;A migraine is an episodic disorder, the centerpiece of which is a severe headache generally associated with nausea and/or light and sound sensitivity,&rdquo; said Dr. Butala.</p><p>Migraines cause severe pain or sensation in your head, usually just on one side. There is no significant clinical difference between migraines on the right side versus the left side. Management remains the same, but most migraines are predominantly unilateral.</p><p>&ldquo;Migraines can affect anyone. About 12% of the population suffers from migraines, and there are subtypes of migraines,&rdquo; Dr. Butala said. &ldquo;Migraine durations vary from person to person. Some complain it lasts an hour, several hours or even multiple days. Common symptoms may include nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to sound and light.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>What triggers a migraine?</strong></p><p>Here are some of the most common, according to Dr. Butala:</p><ul><li>Stress</li><li>Lack of sleep</li><li>Eating habits</li><li>Foods and additives (monosodium glutamate, nitrates and nitrites and aspartame)</li><li>Dehydration</li><li>Alcohol</li><li>Excessive amounts of caffeine</li><li>Smoke</li><li>Weather</li><li>Odors</li><li>For females, a change in hormones</li></ul><p>Migraines often go undiagnosed or untreated. Dr. Butala said you should seek medical advice if you have a family history of migraines, suffer multiple migraines a month, or if symptoms persist for days. Other indicators:</p><ul><li>A new headache arises</li><li>A change in your headache/migraine pattern</li><li>Medication that reduces the frequency or pain no longer works</li><li>If you are age 50 or older and begin experiencing migraines for the first time</li></ul><p>Neuroimaging is not necessary for most patients with migraines. Neuroimaging is usually considered if patients have unexplained or abnormal findings on their neurological examination or complain of headaches that do not fulfill the strict definition of a migraine or other primary headache disorder.</p><p>Treatments vary and are designed to prevent a migraine from happening or reduce the pain once it starts. Among the options:</p><ul><li><strong>Medication:</strong> Can be taken before or during a migraine (Tylenol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiemetics and triptans) or daily medication to help alleviate the severity or frequency (antidepressants, beta-blockers or anti-seizure medications).</li><li><strong>Botox&reg;:</strong> With injections into the forehead, temples and back of the neck, Botox patients have seen a decrease in the number of migraines they experience. Injections are typically administered every three months by neurologists or an ophthalmologist.</li><li><strong><strong style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: initial;\">Acupuncture:</strong></strong> <span style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: initial;\">This is a safe method to treat migraines, but it may not work for everyone.</span></li><li><strong>Vitamins or supplements:</strong> There is scientific evidence for butterbur, coenzyme Q10, feverfew, riboflavin (vitamin B2) and magnesium may help decrease the number of migraines a patient may have.</li><li><strong>Massage therapy:&nbsp;</strong>Frequent massages have shown success in helping people who suffer from migraines manage their pain.</li><li><strong>Physical therapy:</strong> Commonly prescribed to help relax the muscles and trigger points to limit migraines or reduce the pain.</li></ul><p>Dr. Butala and other Baptist Health neurologists may refer patients for physical therapy, neuromuscular massage therapy, neurological rehabilitation or acupuncture to treat migraines.</p><p><em>To schedule a neurological rehab, massage therapy or physical therapy consultation, please contact <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/rehabilitation-services\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health Rehabilitation Services</a> at <a href=\"tel:1-904-202-4200\" target=\"_blank\">904.202.4200</a>.

This guideline is often met through school and after-school activities such as gym, team sports and dance classes.

I worked out at a CrossFit gym, my wife, Erica, goes to CrossBarre (a fitness studio program that combines elements of ballet with strength training), and our three kids had their own sports programs. During this time, we&rsquo;ve been doing family workouts at the house and in the yard.&rdquo;</p><p>The Rush family workouts consist of CrossFit-style exercises such as shuttle runs, burpees, jumping jacks, box jumps, push-ups and sprints. Dr. Rush suggests incorporating body-weight exercises and calisthenics into family workouts since those activities don&rsquo;t require a lot of equipment or clean up.</p><p>&ldquo;A great routine that my four-year-old loves is the &lsquo;zoo workout,&rsquo; alternating different animal movements such as bear crawls, crab walks, bunny hops and duck walks,&rdquo; said Dr. Rush. &ldquo;Not only are these calisthenic exercises fun, but they&rsquo;re also great for flexibility and core strength.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>His older children, ages 8 and 11, enjoy high-intensity interval training workouts. The drills consist of eight sets of fast-paced exercises performed for 20 seconds interspersed with a 10-second rest period. These exercises are quick and effective, making it a great option to incorporate into a home workout.</p><p>Many young athletes, especially those in high school or playing on travel or club teams, are coping with loss. A sports team or club may be their primary social group where they spent up to 12 hours per week practicing or playing their sport.</p><p>&ldquo;Many kids may experience sadness or isolation because they can&rsquo;t play or participate with their team,&rdquo; said Dr. Rush. &ldquo;These reactions are normal and should not be ignored. It&rsquo;s important to talk about it.&rdquo;</p><p>Coaches and parents can help keep young athletes motivated by creating ways to connect virtually as a team. One strategy is to have weekly team meetings through Zoom or FaceTime.</p><p>Another technique is to have virtual team workouts and create a &ldquo;leader board&rdquo; on Google or another online platform for recording individual results for skills work, mobility exercises or aerobic conditioning. In addition to maintaining a workout routine, the activity creates healthy competition that can help ward off feelings of isolation.</p><p>&ldquo;Teamwork and team culture are built throughout the year, and teams can use this time to grow even stronger,&rdquo; said Dr. Rush.</p><p><em>Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital and its partner, Nemours Children&#39;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, provide comprehensive pediatric orthopedic and sports medicine services.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>If the idea of seniors using technology seems unlikely, it&rsquo;s time to think again. The reality is that the majority of people over 65 use technology on a daily basis. Approximately 70% of seniors are online regularly to get news, shop and make travel plans, according to Pew Research Center.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not surprising, then, that older adults are turning to technology for their health. Many have warmed up to the idea of telehealth &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; doctor visits, especially during the COVID-19 crisis when many seniors are staying home as much as possible.</p><p>Virtual visits allow patients to see their doctor face-to-face by using the video camera on their phone, tablet or computer from the safety and comfort of home. At Baptist Health, patients (of all ages) can get routine wellness checks, diagnoses for illness or injuries, help managing pre-existing conditions, and prescriptions when needed. Most specialists, from cardiologists to ENT physicians, offer virtual visits as well.</p><p>David Spaulding, 72, is a patient at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-agewell-institute\">Baptist AgeWell,</a> which provides enriched primary care for those who are 65 and over. He has been with the program for 3-1/2 years and has had four virtual doctor&rsquo;s appointments recently.</p><p>&ldquo;I was a little concerned at first about how telehealth technology would work,&rdquo; Spaulding said. &ldquo;But it was pretty simple. AgeWell sent me an email with a link to the appointment. I clicked on the link and it connected me to the Zoom [videoconferencing] program. The video was clear and I could hear everything easily.&rdquo;</p><p>AgeWell has had good success with patients acclimating to the technology and helps patients and their caregivers navigate through the steps and troubleshoot any possible issues. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gotten easier each time I&rsquo;ve used it,&rdquo; Spaulding said.</p><p>Spaulding&rsquo;s first appointment was an introduction to his doctor, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/geriatrician/dr-vanessa-seiglie-quinones-md\">Vanessa Seiglie, MD,</a> a new geriatrician at AgeWell, to go over his medical history and get to know each other.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been really rewarding to offer virtual visits as a way to be here for our patients who don&rsquo;t want to leave home,&rdquo; said Dr. Seiglie. &nbsp;&ldquo;Virtual visits are an excellent option for patients to get the care they need safely, since delaying appointments can lead to health problems down the road,&rdquo; she said. Dr. Seiglie said her patients have been increasingly open-minded to telehealth appointments.</p><p>&ldquo;I am glad my health wasn&rsquo;t put on hold,&rdquo; said Spaulding. &ldquo;I was able to get good, quality medical care and follow-up without having to leave home.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Baptist Health specialists and primary care physicians offer virtual visits.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is the latest mystery to come from the coronavirus pandemic. It has been likened to Kawasaki disease, it&rsquo;s landing children in the ER and hospital, and doctors are still trying to unravel exactly how it affects kids&rsquo; bodies. MIS-C is on every parent&rsquo;s radar now, but it&rsquo;s hard to understand exactly what it is, why it happens and what to watch for.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-critical-care-specialist/dr-michael-gayle-md\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Gayle, MD</a>, chief of Pediatric Critical Care at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, wants parents to know that this condition is rare. Even though it&rsquo;s all over the news right now, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely to affect your child.</p><p>&ldquo;The first thing folks ought to know is this is a very rare condition associated with COVID-19 in children, and the survival rate is very high,&rdquo; Dr. Gayle said. &ldquo;So far in the U.S., there have been more than 400 cases identified but this number will likely increase. When it comes to COVID-19 cases in children in the U.S., we&rsquo;ve had thousands, so the number of MIS-C cases is low.&rdquo;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re concerned your child has been exposed to COVID-19, be on the lookout for the following symptoms of MIS-C:</p><ul><li>Abdominal pain</li><li>Bloodshot eyes</li><li>Generalized skin rash, including on the lips, hands and feet</li><li>Signs of shock, including rapid breathing or heart rate, low blood pressure and change in mental status</li><li>Very high fever of 101 degrees or higher</li><li>Vomiting or diarrhea</li></ul><p>&ldquo;A typical MIS-C patient will usually present with a very high fever, abdominal pain and may be in a shock-like state, which COVID-19 doesn&rsquo;t present with,&rdquo; he explained.</p><p>MIS-C develops after a child has been exposed to the coronavirus and has had time to develop antibodies against it. So, even if they show no signs of the virus initially, this associated condition can appear a few weeks after they were first infected.</p><p>&ldquo;When a series of MIS-C patients in New York were given the COVID-19 antibody test, about 87% of them tested positive,&rdquo; said Dr. Gayle. &ldquo;To be diagnosed with MIS-C, a patient would have to exhibit some of the symptoms and have a positive viral test for COVID-19, a positive antibody test for COVID-19, or a link to a known COVID-19 case.&rdquo;</p><p>Also, while early news coverage of MIS-C likened it to Kawasaki disease, they&rsquo;re not the same thing. Like MIS-C, Kawasaki disease causes things like rash, bloodshot eyes and vomiting, but only MIS-C is associated with COVID-19 exposure.</p><p>While COVID-19 affects the elderly and those with weaker immune systems at higher rates, MIS-C can affect any child, even one who is totally healthy otherwise.</p><p>&ldquo;No risk factors have been established,&rdquo; Dr. Gayle said. &ldquo;With this condition, most of the children will be between 4 and 15 years old, with most having no preexisting conditions. These are usually normal, previously healthy kids.&rdquo;</p><p>If your child is exhibiting signs of MIS-C, call your pediatrician right away. If your child is severely ill, take him to a <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.com/emergency\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s emergency room</a> immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;Wolfson Children&rsquo;s is specially prepared to handle this condition since it can affect multiple systems of the body and require a team of pediatric expert physicians to treat your child,&rdquo; Dr. Gayle said.</p><p><em>At Baptist Health, we want to help keep our community informed about COVID-19.

I just got up and started to get dressed for work.&rdquo;</p><p>When EMTs arrived at their home, they checked her vitals and decided anxiety was the cause for her fainting spell. Chapman said this is common in female patients with heart conditions since women&rsquo;s symptoms are so different from men&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right, I am anxious. The Gators play basketball tonight for the national championship!&rdquo;</p><p>Thom Chapman called their daughter, a Jacksonville resident who insisted her parents meet her at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville&rsquo;s emergency room to be examined. Chapman assumed they&rsquo;d send her home right away, but when Baptist&rsquo;s staff swept her out of triage and into a room to be monitored, she realized something might really be wrong. She watched the basketball game in her room, cheering on the players as her family watched her heart rate rise when the score got close.</p><p><strong>The final test</strong></p><p>Chapman stayed in the hospital while physicians thoroughly tested for and ruled out multiple conditions. When she passed out on the table during a test, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-girish-shroff-md\" target=\"_blank\">Girish Shroff, MD</a>, a board-certified interventional cardiologist at Baptist Heart Specialists, diagnosed her with sick sinus syndrome with syncope, or fainting.</p><p>&ldquo;Your heart&rsquo;s rhythm is controlled by a specialized area of the heart called the sinus node,&rdquo; said Dr. Shroff. &ldquo;In patients with sick sinus syndrome, the sinus node malfunctions and causes the heart to beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. It can even cause the heart to stop in some cases.&rdquo;</p><p>Sick sinus syndrome is sometimes referred to as adult sudden death syndrome and occurs when there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;glitch&rdquo; in the electrical signals from the brain telling the heart to beat. A pacemaker can send a slight electrical current to the heart if it stops beating, which made this treatment Dr. Shroff&rsquo;s first priority for his patient.</p><p>Dr. Shroff scheduled Chapman&rsquo;s surgery for the following morning and then introduced her to <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiac-electrophysiologist/dr-venkata-sagi-md\" target=\"_blank\">Venkata Sagi, MD</a><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiac-electrophysiologist/dr-venkata-sagi-md\" target=\"_blank\">,</a> a board-certified cardiac electrophysiologist with Baptist Heart Specialists, who placed her pacemaker.</p><p>&ldquo;When we place a pacemaker for a patient with this condition, it&rsquo;s important we do so quickly to ensure the best outcome,&rdquo; said Dr. Sagi. &ldquo;Due to Ms. Chapman&rsquo;s small body frame, we had to take a very delicate approach in using tiny cardiac leads, or wires that connect a pacemaker to the heart. The great news is that once the device is in place, it&rsquo;s expected to last a lifetime.&rdquo;</p><p>Chapman remembered: &ldquo;During the night, I began to have sensations that made me believe it was about to happen again. Was I going to die this time? Would I come back again on my own? Was the third time the charm? My daughter and the amazing nurses held my hands, prayed aloud with me and talked with me until I felt better. It gives me chills and tears thinking about it.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Game time</strong></p><p>Chapman&rsquo;s surgery went exactly as planned. She said her recovery wasn&rsquo;t bad at all. She was discharged to stay with her daughter and family and was medically cleared to go to the Gators&rsquo; spring football game. Her brother, sister and father visited the following week, and she and her dad could swap pacemaker and surgery stories, as he had received one for a different condition before.</p><p>In 2017, she and her family established the Lynn and Thom Chapman Cardiology Endowment, which provides financial support for patients in need of a pacemaker.</p><p>Today, Chapman&rsquo;s heart is doing great. She enjoys her career as site director for Troy University in Brunswick, Georgia. Her family, the beach, and sports still bring her joy each day. And she visits Dr. Sagi&rsquo;s office every six months for a pacemaker checkup. She said she and her family deal with tough circumstances through humor, and her health journey has been no exception.</p><p>&ldquo;When Dr. Shroff was ordering my first pacemaker, I heard him say, &lsquo;And make it the long-life battery.&rsquo; That indicated to me that I might live a while,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only had the pacemaker replaced once and, again, I got a long-life battery. It&rsquo;s a good thing as I intend to make it to 120 years old! But seriously, I am so thankful for the physicians and staff at Baptist. The culture is so caring and professional, and everyone is outstanding in terms of skill, knowledge and expertise.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Baptist Health provides the region&#39;s most comprehensive cardiovascular care.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Let&rsquo;s take a trip down memory lane. Can you remember your senior year? Do you remember how fun it was and the memories you were able to make?</p><p>You look forward to your senior year the first time you step on campus your freshman year. As a freshman, you want to be like the seniors. You have to walk the halls, study and wait three long, grueling years before you are officially called a senior. Finally, it is your time to shine. It is your senior year! You have prom/formal, senior skip days, Senior Night, yearbook signings and graduation to look forward to. All of these events are milestones.</p><p>Earlier this year, many seniors around the nation began missing out on these social events due to COVID-19. Now seniors are having to settle for no physical classes, no prom or formals, and no Senior Nights; instead, they are coping with virtual classes, virtual hangouts and virtual graduation.</p><p>According to Vicki VanGundy, MEd, therapist/licensed mental health counselor intern at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-behavioral-health#locationsMap\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Center for Behavioral Health</a>, young adults are experiencing different emotions due to the cancelation of school events due to COVID-19.</p><p>&ldquo;My patients who are students each have their own perspective on how they are handling this pandemic. We see some students and families who are very disheartened because they have really been looking forward to the celebrations and these milestone events. Other students are experiencing a sense of relief as they tend to have high levels of anxiety. Postponement and cancellation of these events eliminate the stress and anxiety,&rdquo; said VanGundy.</p><p>During these unique times, families, celebrities and the students themselves are rising to the occasion and getting creative to honor and recognize seniors. John Krasinski (the lovable Jim Halpert on &quot;The Office&quot;) created &quot;Some Good News,&quot; which highlights good news around the world during COVID-19. He and other celebrities offered a graduation ceremony for high school seniors, as well as a virtual prom.</p><p>VanGundy offers a few helpful tips for students to help them with their anxiety and stress:</p><ul><li>You know yourself the best. Understand what relieves your stress and anxiety, and use coping skills when needed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Help your parents/guardian understand how you cope with stressful situations so they will know how to support you.</li><li>Use the 478 Breathing technique (Breathe in 4 seconds through your nose, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 seconds.)</li></ul><p>But parents have a responsibility, too. Acknowledge that this time may be difficult for your senior. While this may not be a loss of a family member, it is still a loss, and your student is grieving. They are saying goodbye to their friends, teachers and what they have known for the past four years.</p><p>This year&rsquo;s senior class may not be able to celebrate their hard work and achievements like the classes ahead of them. VanGundy suggests, the next time you see a senior, acknowledge their accomplishments, and congratulate them for their hard work because we are all in this together.</p><p><em>Baptist Behavioral Health has opened virtual offices to provide mental health services to you while practicing social distancing.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Clearly seasonal allergies need to read the room &mdash; can&rsquo;t pollen see that there&rsquo;s a global pandemic happening and adding the sniffles is not cool? Alas, colds and allergies can still strike while COVID-19 is spreading, but it&rsquo;s extra alarming to develop symptoms like a cough or stuffy nose while there&rsquo;s a new type of virus going around.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-josie-maione-md\" target=\"_blank\">Josie Maione, MD</a>, a board-certified family medicine physician with Baptist Primary Care, understands patients experiencing any symptoms of being sick may feel more fear now than they normally would. If you find yourself wondering whether your seasonal allergies are back, you&rsquo;ve caught a cold or may have contracted the coronavirus, here&rsquo;s how she recommends you move forward.</p><p><strong>Telling them apart</strong></p><p>Dr. Maione says if you begin feeling under the weather, the first step is to evaluate how you feel compared to prior years of seasonal allergies and colds. Keep common signs of allergies and cold in mind and ask yourself if you&rsquo;ve felt this way before.</p><p>&ldquo;For patients who have a history of allergies, we&rsquo;re saying try really hard to compare it to your previous episodes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Allergies are extremely common and unfortunately it&rsquo;s an inflammatory process, so you&rsquo;ll get those inflamed-type sensations like headaches with congestion, itchy, watery eyes and postnasal drip, and it can cause fatigue for people who have bad allergic rhinitis. What&rsquo;s similar between allergies and cold is both can cause a cough, both can cause congestion and runny nose, and both can cause fatigue.&rdquo;</p><p>You can also try treatments you know are effective against allergies to see whether they work. If they do, great! If not, you&rsquo;ve ruled out one sickness.</p><p>&ldquo;Do the treatments you know work for you? Try something like FLONASE&reg;, a typical nasal corticosteroid, and your systemic medication, like ZYRTEC&reg; or Claritin&reg;,&rdquo; Dr. Maione explained. &ldquo;Try your treatments consistently for a few days to help get that inflammation down and avoid your triggers. Once your symptoms get better, you can get comfortable knowing it&rsquo;s not COVID-19.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Knowing it&#39;s COVID-19</strong></p><p>Dr. Maione said patients with COVID-19 can experience symptoms including fever (any body temperature above 100.4), body aches, a very sore throat, gastrointestinal issues like nausea and diarrhea, and difficulty breathing. These are signs you aren&rsquo;t dealing with a common cold or reaction to pollen.</p><p>&ldquo;With allergies, you will not have a fever. You can have some shortness of breath if you have asthma, but if you&rsquo;re a healthy person, you should not be getting shortness of breath with seasonal allergies,&quot; she explained. &quot;Fever and body aches are specific to influenza and COVID-19. Losing sense of smell can be seen with allergies, but losing smell and taste is seen with some COVID patients.&rdquo;</p><p>A sore throat can happen during a cold or allergies due to postnasal drip or sleeping with your mouth open while your nose is stuffy. But COVID-positive people may experience a more severe sore throat than usual.</p><p>&ldquo;With allergies, you&rsquo;ve just spent all night draining so you&rsquo;re coughing and sore in the morning. COVID, in some patients, does cause congestion and sore throat, but it seems much more severe and not itchy in nature,&rdquo; Dr. Maione said.</p><p><strong>If you have to get tested</strong></p><p>If you&rsquo;ve spoken with your doctor to rule out allergies or a cold, they may have recommended you visit your nearest COVID testing site. While the idea of being tested for COVID-19 may be anxiety-inducing, Dr. Maione says it&rsquo;s important to get that information and try to remain calm.</p><p>&ldquo;Mild to moderate symptoms may not be fun, but as long as you&rsquo;re breathing OK, your body is doing what it needs to do. Just make sure you&rsquo;re treating with Tylenol for fever and body aches and hydrating excessively,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you have any difficulty breathing, you need to go to the ER for evaluation. During this time, what&rsquo;s recommended is that patients stay home as long as they aren&rsquo;t having altered mental status or breathing difficulty.&rdquo;</p><p><em>At Baptist Health, we want to help keep our community informed about COVID-19.

The drug is administered intravenously within 4.5 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms, but only 15-20% of patients make it to ER on time to qualify for the clot-busting medication.</p><p>Dr. Chmayssani also requested that O&rsquo;Grady be airlifted to Baptist Jacksonville&rsquo;s state-certified <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-center\" target=\"_blank\">Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center&nbsp;</a>for further treatment.</p><p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I would like to send the Baptist LifeFlight helicopter for your husband.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Socialization is a big part of what keeps older adults healthy. Research shows it reduces depression and can even increase longevity. But the COVID-19 crisis makes socializing with seniors much more challenging.</p><p>&ldquo;Older parents and friends need you now more than ever,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/geriatrician/dr-raphael-balbino-md\">Raphael Balbino, MD,&nbsp;</a>a geriatrician at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/geriatric-care\">Baptist AgeWell.</a> &ldquo;The stress and anxiety of COVID-19 tends to affect older people significantly, especially since they are at higher risk of developing more serious complications from the disease,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>So, what can we do to provide support and companionship for older loved ones when in-person visits aren&rsquo;t a good idea?</p><p>&ldquo;Look for creative ways to stay connected,&rdquo; Dr. Balbino said. &ldquo;Social distancing doesn&rsquo;t have to mean social isolation.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Simple technology solutions</strong><br>Simple and technology don&rsquo;t always go together, but today&rsquo;s video chat programs, like FaceTime and Zoom, are easy to use. &ldquo;Contrary to popular belief, many seniors are becoming increasingly comfortable with technology,&rdquo; Dr. Balbino said.</p><p>If your older loved one isn&rsquo;t well versed on how to video chat, walk them through it, step-by-step. Realize it may take patience and time. Consider sending them simple instructions via email (or the regular mail!) on how to get started. For them, there&rsquo;s a big incentive: getting to see family and maybe even little Johnny walking for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;An added benefit of video chatting is that you can see how your older loved one is really doing,&rdquo; Dr. Balbino said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to miss subtle signs of declining health when you are only hearing their voice.&rdquo;</p><p>For many older adults, their faith is a social connection they rely on weekly. Many churches and synagogues have online services you can help them get connected to. And the same is true for social organizations and support groups they may be involved in.</p><p><strong>Encourage extended family and friends to reach out</strong><br>It takes a village, as the saying goes. Friends, grandkids, nephews and nieces can provide support and comfort, too. Encourage kids to send a thoughtful homemade card or letter. Let neighbors know the person is on their own during the COVID crisis and ask them to reach out periodically. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Deliver necessities like food and medication.</strong><br>Understandably, many seniors are reluctant to go the grocery store or run errands. Make sure they&rsquo;re getting their necessities. You can leave them on their front doorstep rather than going inside and say a socially distanced hello.</p><p><strong>Start a virtual book club</strong><br>Pick a book your older loved one is interested in and agree to read it at the same time. Set a date to discuss the book, or do it chapter-by-chapter for more frequent contact.</p><p>Not only is this a great way to sharpen intellectual skills for both of you, it can also be way to delve deeper and maybe even hear some favorite memories or stories for the first time.</p><p>Or, you could involve more family members or friends and have a video chat book discussion.</p><p>&ldquo;The beauty of engaging in these creative ways to connect is that it doesn&rsquo;t have to end when the pandemic does,&rdquo; said Dr. Balbino.</p><p><em>AgeWell accepts Medicare and patients who qualify don&rsquo;t need a doctor&rsquo;s referral.

When coronavirus stay-at-home orders took effect, the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline reported a 20% increase in calls and four times the number of texts compared to the same time last year. Now, doctors are encouraging parents to break this cycle in 2020.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-sarah-robinson-phd\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Robinson, PhD</a>, is a licensed psychologist and board-certified behavior analyst at Baptist Behavioral Health. She says world events are out of everyone&rsquo;s control, and the stressors that come with them can affect every part of daily life.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything that causes disruptions to our routines and makes our lives more difficult can be stressful. When people are stressed, their tolerance for frustration can be lower, and at the same time they may have fewer psychosocial reserves to help them cope,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>COVID-19 has changed so much about daily life, creating stressor after stressor for parents. Not only are they mastering working from home (or being an essential worker at a dangerous time), but they&rsquo;re also trying to help with virtual school, keeping their family healthy and dealing with financial strain if they are experiencing pay cuts or job loss.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a precedent for this,&rdquo; said Dr. Robinson. &ldquo;Day care centers are closed. Many parents are either working as first responders or trying to adjust to working at home or are facing unemployment. Parents are juggling all these things while dealing with the same fears and uncertainty that we are all experiencing.&rdquo;</p><p>While it&rsquo;s understandable to get frustrated &mdash; and to reach an emotional breaking point sooner than usual right now &mdash; there are plenty of ways parents can cope without resorting to violence towards a child. It starts with compassion and self-care.</p><p>&ldquo;The first thing I&rsquo;ve been telling my patients during COVID-19 is to give themselves a break. It&rsquo;s not going to be perfect. Parents need to have realistic expectations for what they can do, and what they can get their kids to do, and let some things go. This can help to reduce some of the pressure,&rdquo; said Dr. Robinson.</p><p>And even if your kiddo hits full-on tantrum mode, as long as they&rsquo;re not in any danger, it&rsquo;s OK for a parent to step away if they need to collect themselves. Mom or Dad can take 10 minutes to regroup, drop and do 10 pushups, or take 10 deep breaths. Whatever &ldquo;taking 10&rdquo; looks like for you is great, so long as it helps you return to the situation calmly. This applies to dealing with older kids and teens, too, who may be just as quick to upset as their parents after all being stuck inside together for weeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Parents can control their own behavior and how they respond. Sometimes parents think they have to do something to stop a tantrum or correct behavior right away. As long as a child isn&rsquo;t doing anything potentially dangerous or harmful, it&rsquo;s okay to just wait a little until the child starts to calm down and then redirect or distract them with something else,&rdquo; Dr. Robinson explained. &ldquo;This gives the parent time to calm down too. Even with older children and teens, parents can discuss behavior and any consequences after everyone is calm.&rdquo;</p><p>While a sense of normalcy can be hard to come by right now, Dr. Robinson suggests spending extra time bonding with your children. Since you&rsquo;re now acting as teachers (and they can feel like tiny, noisy co-workers), it&rsquo;s important to remind each other that you&rsquo;re a family first.</p><p>&ldquo;With parents suddenly in the role of teachers, it&rsquo;s important for parents and children to spend some time just having fun together to maintain a positive relationship,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Parents need to remember to take care of themselves too. This might be taking a few minutes to call family or friends, doing a meditation they find online, or even just taking a minute to take a few deep breaths. It sounds simple but it helps.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Parents can find resources for positive parenting through the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">CDC</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/The-American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-Advises-Parents-Experiencing-Stress-over-COVID-19.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/positive-parenting\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>.</em></p>",

Self-care doesn&rsquo;t have to be time-consuming or expensive. It could mean:</p><ul><li>Deep breathing for a few minutes</li><li>Taking five minutes to clear your head</li><li>Engaging your senses by drinking a hot cup of tea or a cold glass of water</li><li>Listening to your favorite song</li><li>Praying or meditating</li><li>Getting outside and taking a quick walk</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Remember to integrate self-care with great deal of compassion and creativity,&rdquo; Dr. Franco said. &ldquo;These little steps are not meant to bring stress levels all the way down, but they can hold your stress levels where they are and get them a little lower each day.&rdquo;</p><p>Some healthcare workers who are on the front lines may feel they don&rsquo;t have time even for the quick fixes mentioned above. In that case, they should do their best to eat regularly, stay hydrated, and get enough sleep.</p><p><strong>For non-healthcare workers</strong></p><p>For those who are working from home, homeschooling their kids, and adapting to a new normal, Dr. Franco also has some tips for them, too.</p><p>She said creating a structure and routine for each day, with a general outline of what is to come, is key. Within this structure, there should also be some flexibility so the schedule can be adapted as plans change.</p><p><strong>Plan ahead</strong></p><p>Partners and spouses may want to have a business meeting of sorts at the start of the day to go through their schedules, communicate about important milestones, and divvy up household responsibilities. That way the noon conference call that you need to be on doesn&rsquo;t turn into a panic-inducing experience when you realize that your partner isn&rsquo;t around to help the kids with their schoolwork at that time.</p><p><strong>Get the kids involved</strong></p><p>Establishing a routine is especially critical for children, who need to know what to expect and who is in charge. Use this time as an opportunity to work together as a family to solve problems and divide up household tasks. When your kids contribute, praise them for a job well-done.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Limit exposure to the news</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Having the news streaming all day may keep you well-informed, but it may also create more stress for you and your family,&rdquo; Dr. Franco said. Avoid watching the news non-stop, and filter what your kids are seeing on TV so they don&rsquo;t get scared.</p><p><strong>Be realistic</strong></p><p>Dr. Franco said it is also important to set reasonable goals during this time.</p><p>&ldquo;You are not going to be able to accomplish the same things you were accomplishing before,&rdquo; Franco said. &ldquo;Your internal battery is going to get drained. It&rsquo;s important to be discerning and learn what you can let go of or push pause on. Shift the expectations of yourself, do the best you can, and trust that that is enough.&rdquo;</p><p>Baptist Behavioral Health has opened virtual offices to provide mental health services to you, while practicing social distancing.

During the COVID-19 crisis, you&rsquo;d prefer not to go to your doctor&rsquo;s office unless you&rsquo;re really sick.</p><p>This is the approach many people are probably taking to their health care right now. But is it the right one?</p><p>Not necessarily. With so many <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/online-doctor-visits?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=juice&utm_campaign=juice&utm_content=juice&utm_keyword=juice\" target=\"_blank\">virtual healthcare options</a> available now, there&rsquo;s no excuse not to see your doctor for that check-up or that follow-up appointment, as Chetan Hampole, MD, a cardiologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=juice&utm_campaign=juice&utm_content=juice&utm_keyword=juice\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a>, explains.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; Dr. Hampole said. &ldquo;As we use the video platforms more, we get better at doing virtual visits.&rdquo;</p><p>Baptist Health is not alone in seeing a drastic rise in virtual appointments since the start of COVID-19. It&rsquo;s a trend that has been seen across the U.S. as health systems aim to minimize the risk of spreading the disease.</p><p>Dr. Hampole&rsquo;s office, for example, is maintaining normal business hours but conducting most of their visits virtually. He has seen patients with heart symptoms who were referred by their primary care physicians. He is also seeing patients who went to the emergency room and got discharged but were asked to follow up with a cardiologist about their condition.</p><p>Because of virtual visits, it&rsquo;s that much easier for patients to follow up with him, allowing Dr. Hampole to go through the patient&rsquo;s history and review medical records, as well as ordering tests and even prescribing medications when needed. He said that sometimes patients aren&rsquo;t aware they are having symptoms of cardiovascular disease or stroke until they talk through them with their doctor.</p><p>However, Dr. Hampole said having access to this technology doesn&rsquo;t mean that people should avoid coming in to see their primary care doctor or specialist, or going to the ER if they are having a health emergency.</p><p>&ldquo;When patients need a face-to-face visit, we are here for them, and we&rsquo;re ensuring our facilities are clean, safe and ready,&rdquo; Dr. Hampole said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/internist/dr-joseph-czerkawski-md?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=juice&utm_campaign=juice&utm_content=juice&utm_keyword=juice\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Czerkawski, MD</a>, an internist with Baptist Health who focuses on sports medicine, is also conducting virtual visits. He has been seeing patients with chronic health conditions such as diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure), as well as athletes with joint, neck or back pains. Dr. Czerkawski says preventive health measures are also critical during this time.</p><p>He is encouraging his patients to eat plant-based diets and keep up a daily exercise routine, as well as to take vitamin D to help maintain calcium levels.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Concern about coronavirus (COVID-19) is high, but the risk for serious illness to children seems to be low. So far, most reported cases of coronavirus have been in adults. Kids who do get it seem to have milder infections than adults or older people.</p><p>Experts are still learning about COVID-19, so we don&#39;t have all the information yet. Still, parents wonder what to do if their child gets sick.</p><p><strong>What if my child gets a fever, cough, or sore throat? Could it be COVID-19?</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Do your best to stay calm.&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Call your doctor.</strong> Your doctor knows your child&#39;s health history and will know if your child has any special risks. The doctor will ask how your child is doing and if they&#39;ve been around someone with known or suspected coronavirus. Your doctor&#39;s office will tell you what to do next and whether you need an in-person visit.</li><li><strong>Get a telehealth visit.&nbsp;</strong>If this option is available in your area, a health care provider can see your child while you stay at home. If you can, choose a telehealth provider who specializes in caring for kids. If the doctor thinks your child needs care right away, they will guide you on where to go. Check for telehealth in your area now, before anyone in your family is sick.</li><li><strong>Keep your child home</strong>. This keeps your child away from other germs. It also helps prevent your child from spreading the illness to others. If the doctor thinks your child might have coronavirus, the whole family will need to stay home.</li><li><strong>Keep other people and pets in the house away from your child as much as possible.</strong></li><li><strong>T</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>y to have one person only care for the sick child so others are not exposed.</strong></li></ol><p>If your child is over 2 years old and can wear a face mask or cloth face-covering without finding it hard to breathe, have them wear one when the caregiver is in the room. Don&#39;t leave your child alone while they&#39;re wearing a mask or cloth face covering. If your child can&#39;t wear one, the caregiver should wear one when in the same room. To see how to put on and remove face masks and coverings, clean them, or make your own cloth face covering, check the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\" target=\"_blank\">CDC&#39;s guide</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>If possible, have your sick child use a different bathroom from others</strong>. If that isn&#39;t possible, wipe down the bathroom often.</li><li><strong>Everyone in your family should wash their hands well and often</strong>. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li><li><strong>Use regular household cleaners or wipes to clean things that get touched a lot (doorknobs, light switches, toys, remote controls, phones, etc.).</strong> Do this every day.</li><li><strong>Help your child get plenty of rest and drink lots of liquids.</strong></li><li>W<strong>atch for signs that your child might need more medical help</strong>, such as trouble breathing, fast breathing, sleepiness, not being able to drink a lot of liquids, or signs of dehydration like peeing less than usual.</li></ul><p><strong>Should I get my child checked for COVID-19?</strong></p><p>With the nonstop news coverage, it&#39;s easy to think that coronavirus symptoms are an emergency. But it&#39;s important not to run to the ER at the first sign of fever.</p><p>Instead, call your doctor or use telehealth if your child has:</p><ul><li>A fever</li><li>A cough</li><li>Sore throat</li><li>Fast breathing</li><li>Signs of dehydration, such as not peeing for 8-12 hours, no tears when crying, or being less active than usual</li></ul><p>They&#39;ll help you know if you can care for your child at home or if you need to go to the doctor&#39;s office or the ER.</p><p>Go to the ER if your child:</p><ul><li>Has breathing problems. Look for muscles pulling in between the ribs or the nose puffing out with each breath.</li><li>Is confused or very sleepy</li></ul><p>Call 911 if your child is struggling to breathe, is too out of breath to talk or walk, or turns blue.</p><p><strong>How do doctors test people for COVID-19?</strong></p><p>Testing for COVID-19 is changing. Doctors, hospitals, commercial labs, local health departments, and the U.S. Public Health Service are working together to help get tests to the people who need them.</p><p>To test someone for coronavirus, doctors send a mucus sample from the nose and back of the throat to a lab. If the person coughs up mucus, doctors might send that for testing too.</p><p>If you think your child has symptoms of COVID-19, call your doctor or the Baptist Health COVID-19 Nurse Help Line at <a href=\"tel:1-904-302-5050\" target=\"_blank\">904.302.5050</a>. They will give you the most up-to-date information on testing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How is COVID-19 treated?</strong></p><p>Doctors and researchers are working on medicines and a vaccine for coronavirus. Most people with the illness, including children, get better with rest, fluids, and fever-reducing medicine.</p><p><strong>What else should I know?</strong></p><p>Keep doing these things to keep your family healthy:</p><ul><li>Wash hands well and often.</li><li>Cover coughs and sneezes.</li><li>Avoid contact with other people, especially those who are sick.</li></ul><p><em>Sourc</em><em>e:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://kidshealth.org\" target=\"_blank\"><em>KidsHealth from Nemours</em></a></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>In late January, Ditannon Otis Sr. was enjoying a relaxing Saturday morning at home with his wife and kids when he started experiencing an excruciating headache.</p><p>The 43-year-old Jacksonville electrician was scheduled to leave town the very next day for an out-of-state work assignment.</p><p>&ldquo;If he had gotten on the road, there is no telling what the outcome would have been,&rdquo; said Otis&rsquo; wife, Atlin. &ldquo;After he started complaining about his headache, he went outside and sat down on a patio chair and the next thing we knew, he was having a seizure. His eyes rolled back in his head and when they came back down, he was just staring at his 16-year-old son, D.J. Jr.&rdquo;</p><p>Rescue personnel rushed Otis to a nearby hospital.</p><p>After a CT scan of his brain revealed he had suffered a severe subarachnoid hemorrhage, a life-threatening type of stroke caused by bleeding into the space surrounding the brain, Otis was immediately transported to <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>, a state-certified Comprehensive Stroke Center dedicated to the rapid diagnosis and treatment of stroke and aneurysms.</p><p>A subarachnoid hemorrhage usually results from a ruptured aneurysm. In Otis&rsquo; case, he suffered what&rsquo;s called a fusiform-shaped aneurysm, which bulges out on all sides of a blood vessel.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1511539601/BaptistJax/Doctors/physician/eric-sauvageau-md-inset-l.jpg\" alt=\"Sauvageau\"></div><p>&ldquo;Until as recently as six years ago, we didn&rsquo;t really have the technology to fix that,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-eric-sauvageau-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Sauvageau, MD</a>, co-director of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-center\" target=\"_blank\">Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center&nbsp;</a>at Baptist Jacksonville. &ldquo;Twenty percent of the people who have this kind of stroke will die before making it to the hospital. About a third of those who make it to the hospital will not have a good outcome.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Flow-diversion technology</strong></p><p>Treatment for the type of aneurysm Otis experienced focuses on stopping the bleeding, restoring normal blood flow and preventing vasospasm, or constriction of blood vessels. A stroke of any type can cause permanent disability but hemorrhagic stroke is more often fatal.</p><p>Dr. Sauvageau decided his best course of action was to perform a minimally invasive procedure known as Pipeline&reg; embolization to cut off blood supply to the affected area of the brain.</p><p>&ldquo;Before this happened, I didn&rsquo;t know much about that kind of surgery my husband had, but I do now,&rdquo; Atlin Otis said. &ldquo;I was so relieved to learn that Dr. Sauvageau had a plan.&rdquo;</p><p>During the endovascular procedure, Dr. Sauvageau guided a thin, flexible tube called a microcatheter through a main artery in Otis&rsquo; leg. Once the catheter reached the brain, a permanent stent known as a flow diverter was deployed inside the damaged vessel.</p><p>It takes at a least a month for the damaged brain vessel to regrow new cells around the permanent stent, according to Dr. Sauvageau. An external ventricular drain (EVD) was also placed on the top of Otis&rsquo; head to relive pressure and drain any excessive amounts of cerebrospinal fluid.</p><p>Otis spent just over a month recovering from his traumatic stroke in the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-center\" target=\"_blank\">Neurointensive Care Unit&nbsp;</a>at Baptist Jacksonville, which provides critical care to patients with neurological conditions.</p><p>Atlin rarely left her husband&rsquo;s bedside. She kept a journal of his 34-day hospital stay and kept friends and family apprised of his condition via Facebook posts.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy to report that Ditannon is stable and all of his reports are positive,&rdquo; wrote Atlin on her Facebook page. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s still having his ups and downs but they said his progress has been truly amazing, considering the extent of his stroke.&rdquo;</p><p>Added Dr. Sauvageau: &ldquo;These things take time, but down the road, I expect him to be back to his normal activities.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Navy veteran</strong></p><p>A retired veteran who spent 20 years in the U.S. Navy, Otis met Atlin in the late 1990s, while he was serving on the aircraft carrier USS America, then homeported in Norfolk, Va.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s used to being a very self-sufficient man, but with the support of family and friends, he is making progress and accepts that his recovery is going to take a while,&rdquo; Atlin said. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t believe he spent the entire month of February in the hospital.&rdquo;</p><p>A native of the U.S. Virgin Islands and a member of the Virgin Islands Caribbean Association of Jacksonville, Atlin recently participated in the annual World of Nations celebration.</p><p>The three-day festival is North Florida&rsquo;s largest multicultural event, drawing an estimated 75,000 visitors each year.</p><p>Dressed in a traditional head-tie and madras attire, Atlin hosted a booth at the festival and took part in the traditional Parade of Flags. D.J. Otis Jr. demonstrated another Virgin Islands custom &ndash; stilt dancing.</p><p>To her surprise, Atlin spotted Dr. Sauvageau and his wife, along with their two children, in the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;I let his wife know how thankful I was for everything he and the caring hospital staff did for my husband,&rdquo; Atlin recalled. &ldquo;My rock is finally home.&rdquo;</p><p><em>BE FAST and CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY if you observe any sign of a stroke.

We are mentally and physically exhausted. We are missing our family and friends dearly as we follow the rules of social distancing. We are overwhelmed and saddened when we sit and watch the news and see the numbers. We are frightened and scared that we could bring this home to our families. Yet we all entered this field because of the inner urge to care for people and we return to work every day with no regrets. My experience yesterday was a prime example of why we do what we do.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"%20https%3A//res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1587756805/Juice/legendary_caregiver.png\" alt=\"legendary_caregiver\"></div><p>Within the walls of our children&rsquo;s hospital, we have specialists from a number of different healthcare institutions who come together to care of our children. Yesterday was a GREAT example of the patients who inspire our teamwork.</p><p>The whole team knew what would happen that day. A baby was scheduled to be born with complex congenital heart disease and was going to need our help immediately. We had meticulously prepared for this day and had discussed, in great detail, who would be there, what their role was, and where they were going to be when needed. The baby was delivered by C-section in our cardiovascular surgical suite at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital while a large team anxiously waited in the adjacent OR suite. Babies being born at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital is not the usual; they&rsquo;re usually born in Labor &amp; Delivery at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>. This baby was special because of the complexity of the child&rsquo;s heart condition and the need for immediate care, with not a minute to spare for a transfer from L&amp;D to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. The teams consisted of:</p><ul><li>UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville pediatric cardiologists and nurses</li><li>UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville neonatologists</li><li>UPMC Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Pittsburgh pediatric cardiothoracic surgeons</li><li>Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists</li><li>Pediatric nurses, radiologic technologists, cath technologists, respiratory therapists, surgical technologists, echocardiogram technologists and a perfusionist</li><li>Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville obstetrician and Labor &amp; Delivery team</li></ul><p>The word was given that the incision had been made and the baby should be here within minutes. Then the words rang out, &ldquo;Baby is born.&rdquo; The room fell silent as everyone mentally prepared and reviewed the role they were about to play.</p><p>The baby was rushed into the silent OR room and then let out a whimper and then began to cry. It was the most wonderful sound that our ears could hear. The room erupted into activity as the teams feverishly worked together to save this little life. We forgot the chaos, the anxiety, the fear, the pandemic that was happening in the world around us. Our only focus was on this one little life and doing everything we could to save this critically ill baby.</p><p>This little one is recovering and was cared for by our AMAZING staff in the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. I can only imagine the story these parents will be able to tell about how their precious baby brought a huge team together and allowed them to forget the chaos and anxiety for a brief moment. &nbsp;This is why I do what I do. For that I am eternally grateful! Stay safe, everyone!</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>As in cities and hospitals across the nation, local healthcare facilities experienced a significant decline in ER visits and hospitalizations in recent weeks. At a time when hospitals have been busy preparing for a COVID-19 surge, fewer people in healthcare facilities for non-coronavirus conditions may sound like a good thing. But one possible reason behind some of the decline in visits may actually be very bad for certain patients&rsquo; health.</p><p>&ldquo;Due to a fear of COVID-19 infection and a misconception that local Emergency Departments and hospitals are overwhelmed, some people are putting off care that should not be delayed,&rdquo; said emergency medicine physician <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/emergency-medical-specialist/dr-jeremy-wood-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremy Wood, MD</a>, with <a href=\"http://ergjax.com\" target=\"_blank\">Emergency Resources Group&nbsp;</a>and medical director of the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-south\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center South Emergency Center</a><a href=\"https://ergjax.com/\" target=\"_blank\"></a>. &ldquo;We have seen fewer patients overall, but particularly concerning is the fact that there has been a dramatic decline in patients coming in with conditions such as heart attacks, sepsis (a life-threatening infection), strokes, and acute abdominal conditions such as appendicitis. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense that these medical situations are not happening so my worry is that patients are not coming in when they really need to.&rdquo;</p><p>Interventional cardiologist <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-salil-patel-md\" target=\"_blank\">Salil Patel, MD</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a> is observing the same trend. &ldquo;We are seeing fewer heart attack patients than we would expect,&rdquo; said Dr. Patel. &ldquo;We have canceled elective cardiac catheterization cases, but our inpatient cardiac catheterization lab volume is markedly reduced. That is very unusual and we are concerned that people aren&rsquo;t seeking life-saving cardiac care when they need it most. Baptist Health has designated areas in our ERs and hospitals where patients with COVID-19 are isolated from patients with other conditions. ER doctors and hospital doctors evaluate patients and release them to go home as soon as possible to avoid potential exposure. It is safe to seek emergency care at Baptist Health.&rdquo;</p><p>While endovascular neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-ricardo-hanel-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ricardo Hanel, MD, PhD</a>, co-director of the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/brain-and-spine/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center</a> hasn&rsquo;t seen as much of a decline in stroke cases as his colleagues in other COVID-19 epicenters, he is concerned the downturn may worsen in coming days and what that could mean to local patients.</p><p>&ldquo;We have already had a couple of patients with stroke symptoms decline medical treatment and leave against medical advice because of a fear of COVID-19 infection,&rdquo; said Dr. Hanel. &ldquo;Stroke and aneurysms are very serious problems. We understand the fear caused by all of the massive communication about COVID-19 but the odds of having a life-altering medical outcome for not seeking proper medical care are far higher than the risk of getting COVID-19 in a healthcare setting.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Parents also avoiding ERs with potentially dire consequences</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-emergency-medicine-specialist/dr-anthony-pohlgeers-md\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Pohlgeers, MD</a>, chief of Pediatric Emergency Medicine for <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.com\">Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospita</a>l and medical director of Pediatric Emergency Medicine for Emergency Resources Group, said there are many reasons for fewer children&rsquo;s ER visits and hospitalizations in the wake of COVID-19.</p><p>&ldquo;First, most likely, is the success of social distancing and quarantine. This policy has kept children out of day cares and schools right in the midst of respiratory disease season, thus limiting their exposure to those diseases and to illness,&rdquo; Dr. Pohlgeers explained. &ldquo;Combine this with the lack of sports competition and this, in turn, limits the sports injuries we see. Third, and most concerning: parents are deferring and/or delaying visits to the ER for reasons that, in the past, would have prompted a visit. They are doing this because of the fear of exposure to and of contracting COVID-19.&rdquo;</p><p>While there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children and teens in our area, they make up only a small percentage of the total cases. &ldquo;When children do get COVID-19, for the most part, they are spared the severity of illness like that seen in adults,&rdquo; Dr. Pohlgeers said. &ldquo;As a result, many do not even seek medical care. What this means is that there are some children suffering from other serious illnesses that will become problematic if they do not seek care in an Emergency Department.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Pohlgeers and his <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/emergency\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Emergency Center</a> colleagues are already seeing kids coming in with non-COVID-19 medical conditions who are sicker than usual, even during flu season.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re learning from multiple children&rsquo;s hospitals in Italy, who are about three weeks ahead of us in their social restrictions, that they&rsquo;re seeing parents delay bringing their children for illnesses and trauma, resulting in worse outcomes than expected. They have had children come to their hospitals with diagnoses of appendicitis, new-onset diabetes, and other serious illnesses because parents have waited days after symptom development and now these children are experiencing preventable prolonged hospitalization, complications and sometimes worse.</p><p>&ldquo;In our own Emergency Departments, we are seeing increased percentages of children requiring hospital admission, above what would have been expected with decreased ER volumes. This suggests that delay in seeking care is resulting in otherwise preventable hospitalizations and complications, much like the Italian experience.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Heed warning signs&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Dr. Patel said symptoms of a heart attack, a medical emergency, should not be ignored. They may include:</p><ul><li>Chest discomfort. &ldquo;It can be chest pressure, heaviness or tightness that can sometimes feel like something sitting on your chest,&rdquo; Dr. Patel explained.</li><li>Pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach</li><li>Shortness of breath, with or without chest discomfort</li><li>Breaking out into a cold sweat, nausea, vomiting or lightheadedness</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Heart disease is still the No. 1 killer in the world, even with the COVID-19 pandemic,&rdquo; said Dr. Patel &ldquo;Although it is appropriate to try to avoid exposure to COVID-19, Baptist Health is prepared to safely evaluate and treat patients who come in for cardiac issues. The alternative may be that people may die at home or suffer more significant events due to a heart attack not being treated appropriately in a timely fashion.&rdquo;&#39;</p><p>Likewise, there are some signs of stroke to be on the lookout for. Dr. Hanel recommends people remember the acronym, BE FAST:</p><p><strong>B</strong> - Balance: Is there a sudden loss of balance or coordination?</p><p><strong>E</strong> - Eyes: Is there sudden vision loss, persistent blurred vision and/or sudden trouble seeing?</p><p><strong>F&nbsp;</strong>- Face: Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop?</p><p><strong>A</strong> - Arms: Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?</p><p><strong>S</strong> - Speech: Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is their speech slurred, strange, or are they unable to speak?</p><p><strong>T</strong> - Time: If you observe any of these signs call 911 immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;If you have any symptoms of a stroke or sudden onset of headache, you should seek emergency medical care,&rdquo; Dr. Hanel added. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t play down these symptoms. This could be the difference between life and death or a life with a disability. The faster you seek care, the better your chances for treatment and recovery.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t delay in an emergency</strong></p><p>If you&rsquo;re a parent, how do you know if your child&rsquo;s symptoms warrant a call to the pediatrician or an ER visit? &ldquo;Parents have great instincts so trust your gut,&rdquo; said Dr. Pohlgeers. &ldquo;If you think your child may be experiencing a medical emergency, call your child&rsquo;s pediatrician, bring your child to the ER or call 911. Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Emergency Centers are here for your children 24 hours a day 7 days a week. We go to extremes to make sure that our ERs are safe to visit through prescreening and screening at the door.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Wood said, &ldquo;People need to know that Baptist Health and all of our Emergency Centers are willing, ready and able to see them in a safe manner and that we have the capability to care for them without exposing them to risk of infection with the processes we have had and continue to have in place.&rdquo;</p><p><em>At Baptist Health, we want to help keep our community informed about COVID-19.

It&rsquo;s the second-most common type of disruptive behavior among dementia patients after wandering, according to a study in <em>Psychiatry Investigation</em>.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s thought to affect up to two-thirds of patients with dementia,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/geriatrician/dr-raphael-balbino-md\" target=\"_blank\">Raphael Tito Balbino</a>, MD, a board-certified geriatrician with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/geriatric-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist AgeWell Center for Senior Health</a>. &ldquo;Unfortunately, a number of our patients suffer symptoms of sundowning.&rdquo;</p><p>Sundown syndrome commonly occurs in the middle stages of dementia and the hyperactivity it produces can lead to patient falls and aggression. Caregivers, whether in the home, a hospital, an assisted living facility or a skilled nursing center, often take the brunt of this aggressive behavior.</p><p>Because each patient has a different manifestation, there isn&rsquo;t a clear consensus on the definition of this phenomenon. In addition, there are no validated screening tools that can be universally applied.</p><p>&ldquo;There are no established treatments for this condition and very few clinical trials studying the effectiveness of treatment options,&rdquo; added Dr. Balbino. &ldquo;Even anti-anxiety medications may not work well for these patients and could even paradoxically backfire and worsen their agitation.&rdquo;</p><p>The best approach is to keep these patients on a very specific schedule with as much natural sunlight during the day and plenty of opportunities for physical activity. &ldquo;One way caregivers can minimize sundowning is to provide a calming presence that will help orient the patient back to reality in a reassuring tone when they are anxious and confused,&rdquo; Dr. Balbino recommended.</p><p><em>If you are concerned your loved may have sundown syndrome, speak with your health care provider.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-agewell-institute\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist AgeWell geriatricians</em></a><em>&nbsp;specialize in working with adults over the age of 65.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p><em>Our guest columnist is Randell Alexander, MD, is a child abuse pediatrician and chief of the Division of Child Protection and Forensic Pediatrics at the UF College of Medicine -- Jacksonville.</em></p><p>In this time of stress, let&rsquo;s not forget that young parents and children need our help. &nbsp;With hurricanes and other natural disasters, child abuse rates increase. With coronavirus, the disaster will be prolonged. Children are out of school and daycare. Parents may have lost their jobs. Fear of sickness and continuous media coverage create psychological burdens not only on adults but children. Physical distancing should not equate to social isolation for children.</p><p>April is Child Abuse Prevention Month. Typically, this is a time when blue ribbons remind us of the more than 2,000 children who die each year from neglect and physical abuse, and the hundreds of thousands of child survivors who endure pain, suffering, humiliation, injury, and trauma. Often the psychological consequences last a lifetime.</p><p>Research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and others has shown that with the more types of abuse that a child sustains, the greater the health declines, even for adults. With more adverse childhood experiences there is more adult drug and alcohol use, mental health problems, and domestic violence. Less obvious is that increased adverse childhood experiences result in a higher risk of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, problems with work, severe obesity, and even decreased lifespan. Research has shown substantial negative brain changes with sexual abuse, physical abuse, and neglect &ndash; often changing the brain forever.</p><p>The vast majority of parents do not want this for their children. Yet the stresses of isolation and fear increase the chance that a child might be physically abused or left alone. Isolation can breed sexual abuse. The FBI warns about online predators exploiting the increased screen time of children at home.</p><p>Here are some things we can do to support each other:</p><ul><li><strong>Help parents understand what normal development i</strong>s. Babies cry. Sometimes a lot. Coping with crying is an important skill for parents to master. Put your baby down for 5 minutes, safely in a crib or playpen and walk out of the room. Better yet, call someone for support or have someone take over for a respite.</li><li><strong>Toddlers often seem oppositional</strong>. It seems like their job description. Help them by gentle quiet time and redirection. Reinforcing their positive behaviors leads to better overall behaviors than attention only when they misbehave.</li><li><strong>Help parents who have to work and should not leave their children home alone</strong>. Parents need to find ways to band together to take care of children and still provide for the family.</li><li><strong>Listen carefully to children if they seem anxious or fearful</strong>. With any concerns about abuse, call the Florida Hotline at <a href=\"tel:1-800-962-2873\" target=\"_blank\">800.962.2873</a> or go <a href=\"https://www.myflfamilies.com/service-programs/abuse-hotline/report-online.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">online</a>.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Resources for parent</em></strong><em><strong>s&nbsp;</strong>can be found at websites for the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">CDC</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/The-American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-Advises-Parents-Experiencing-Stress-over-COVID-19.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/positive-parenting\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</em></a></p>",

That&#39;s why the Y Healthy Living Centers are providing an opportunity for you to hone in on self-care activities and explore things you may not have ever done before.</p><p>To encourage you to stop, slow down, and take care of yourself, print out our 30-Day Self-Care Challenge and start checking off activities as you complete them:</p><div class=\"u-size4of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1586900230/Juice/Coping_with_COVID_chart_v01.jpg\" alt=\"coping with COVID\"></div><p>As a wellness coach, my main role is to motivate others in adopting new behaviors for a healthy lifestyle, while also being a voice of reason in guiding clients to realistic goals that may seem small, but have a huge impact if repeated daily. That is my advice to you: make this 30-day challenge realistic! I suggest setting aside time for one activity per day.</p><p>Here are some other helpful tips:</p><ul><li><strong>Plan ahead!</strong> Like with any new thing you&rsquo;re starting, it&#39;s easier when you plan ahead. Review your schedule for the next few days or week and pick out which activities you would like to do on which days. Some days will be busier than others, if that&rsquo;s the case, don&rsquo;t mark that day for an activity. If it is helpful, put the activity on your calendar or set an alarm on your phone to remind you.</li><li><strong>Be flexible and practice self-forgiveness.</strong> Many of us have high expectations for ourselves for what we can get done each day or a varying level of motivation. If you are feeling overwhelmed or down about yourself, stop for a moment, acknowledge this feeling and try to do it in a non-judgmental way. Instead of telling yourself, &quot;It is bad that I feel overwhelmed&quot; (judgmental), substitute that with the non-judgmental phrase, &quot;I feel overwhelmed.&quot;</li></ul><p>Once you have done this and feel you are ready, try to reframe the situation; &ldquo;It is okay that I feel overwhelmed, maybe instead of doing X activity, I will do Y activity instead. It is not the activity I planned for, but I am still doing an activity that will help me reach my goal. I will plan to do the other activity tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><ul><li><strong>Do the challenge with a friend or family member</strong>. Having someone doing the challenge with you keeps you accountable and motivated.</li><li><strong>Celebrate yourself!&nbsp;</strong>Whether it is a simple pat on your back or something more elaborate like purchasing something you want, it is important to take a moment to celebrate yourself when you accomplish something, big or small.</li></ul>",

For Rebecca Schrum, now 24 years old and a social worker at Baptist Medical Center South, that defining life event was her fight with brain cancer.</p><p>&ldquo;I would probably not be in the career I am today, I wouldn&rsquo;t have met my husband, it would have been such a different life,&rdquo; Schrum said. &ldquo;And I wouldn&rsquo;t change it for anything.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>One terrifying night</strong></p><p>In the weeks leading up to March 14, 2009, Schrum had been having terrible headaches and nausea. That evening, then-13-year-old Schrum she was playing hide-and-seek outside at a friend&rsquo;s house when she started feeling sick, and needed her friend&rsquo;s help to make it to the front porch.</p><p>&ldquo;My dad came and picked me up right away,&rdquo; Schrum said. &ldquo;We passed <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/locations/south-er\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist South</a> on the way home and my dad asked me if I thought we needed to go, but I was kind of stubborn and said I just wanted to go home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As soon as I got home, I started projectile vomiting,&rdquo; Schrum continued. &ldquo;My mom is a nurse and she said she&rsquo;s never seen that much vomit before. So as soon as my mom got me cleaned up and dressed, we went to Baptist South.&rdquo;</p><p>Though much of that night is a blur, Schrum remembers certain snapshots: a waiting room, her parents&rsquo; concerned faces, and the doctor entering an exam room with what would be life-changing news.</p><p>&ldquo;Once the doctor came into the room, everything was in slow motion,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He told us they found a brain mass on the CT scan. I remember, in what seemed like slow motion, my parents looking at each other and grabbing each other&rsquo;s hands, and then slowly looking at me and grabbing my hand. And then their eyes began to water. Immediately after, I was on an ambulance on my way to <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/cancer\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Beating brain cancer</strong></p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1586786053/Juice/Becca2.jpg\" alt=\"“beccaasachild”\"></div><p>Two days later, <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-neurosurgeon/dr-philipp-aldana-md\" target=\"_blank\">Philipp Aldana, MD</a>, co-medical director of the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/brain\" target=\"_blank\">Stys Neuroscience Institute</a>, medical director of the Lucy Gooding Children&rsquo;s Neurosurgery Center, and pediatric neurosurgeon with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville, removed the lime-sized tumor from Schrum&rsquo;s brain. It was later confirmed to be <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/brain/brain-and-spine-tumors\" target=\"_blank\">medulloblastoma</a>.</p><p>Schrum spent two weeks in the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/supporting-services/picu\" target=\"_blank\">Pediatric Intensive Care Unit</a>. Surgery was followed by 15 months of chemotherapy and six months of radiation, along with proton therapy. Each person Schrum met inspired her along the way.</p><p>&ldquo;Throughout my treatment and the time after, it kept motivating me to want to use my past to do something in the medical field and it led me to social work,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><strong>Beginning at Baptist</strong></p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatRight u-spaceLeft05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1586786053/Juice/Becca_BH_orientation.jpg\" alt=\"“beccaorientation”\"></div><p>Just a couple years after Schrum finished treatment, she decided to start her career giving back to the people who helped her get through her cancer fight, as well as those going through their own health battles. It began with a position volunteering at the gift shop at Baptist South, the same place where she found out about her tumor.</p><p>&ldquo;Going back to where I was diagnosed for the first could time was a little eerie, but once I started, it was amazing,&rdquo; Schrum said.</p><p>One moment, in particular, sticks with her all these years later.</p><p>&ldquo;This one woman came into the gift shop and was sobbing,&rdquo; Schrum recalled. &ldquo;She just opened up to me and told me how her husband was in the ICU and was not going to make it through the night. She was looking for something to help tell her son that his father was going to pass away that night, but would also provide him comfort. She told me all about her husband and what a great father he was. She was giving me this precious time that she could be spending elsewhere and trusting me with this information. It just meant so much.&rdquo;</p><p>Schrum went on to study social work in college. In order to receive her bachelor&rsquo;s degree, she needed to complete an internship, which she did at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville. About a month before the internship ended, she accepted a position as a social worker with Baptist Health, initially assigned to the Neuro ICU and Progressive Care Unit (PCU) at Baptist Jacksonville.</p><p><strong>Food and fate</strong></p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1586786053/Juice/Becca_Wedding.jpg\" alt=\"“beccawedding”\"></div><p>One day, as she was eating lunch in the first floor caf&eacute; of Baptist Jacksonville, Schrum was approached by a man named Michael, who was a medical student at the time.</p><p>&ldquo;He just sat down with me and we started talking,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We exchanged phone numbers and six months later, we were engaged; six months after that, we were married!&rdquo;</p><p>That, alone, sounds like the start of a lasting love story. But months into their courtship, it seemed more like destiny that Michael and Rebecca found each other.</p><p>&ldquo;We were discussing our parents&rsquo; occupations,&rdquo; Schrum said. &ldquo;His dad is an allergist at Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, and his mom is a pediatric anesthesiologist at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, and I thought that was interesting. So I looked back at my medical records, and come to find out, she was the anesthesiologist for my tumor resection.&rdquo;</p><p>Michael also worked closely with <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-hematologist-oncologist/dr-eric-sandler-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Sandler, MD</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-hematologist-oncologist/dr-scott-bradfield-md\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Bradfield, MD</a>, Schrum&rsquo;s pediatric hematologists/oncologists with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, during his medical school rotations.</p><p>The two tied the knot in June 2019.</p><p><strong>Running forward</strong></p><p>Schrum transferred from Baptist Jacksonville to Baptist South in November 2019. She is currently working on getting her master&rsquo;s degree from Florida State University, with the ultimate goal of being a social worker on the pediatric hematology/oncology floor at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s.</p><p>In January 2020, Schrum checked off another milestone as she crossed the finish line of the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrenschallenge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Challenge</a> 30K race with Michael and her father, David.</p><p>&ldquo;I loved being able to see those faces and read those names along the way,&rdquo; she said of the signs featuring <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrenschallenge.com/race-info/why-55\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s patients</a> along the race route. &ldquo;It was so inspiring.&rdquo;</p><p>With the race now behind her, Schrum is turning her attention toward the future and continuing the purpose she discovered over a decade ago.</p><p>&ldquo;My cancer battle has shaped me in every way,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It has made me the person I am today.&rdquo;</p><p><em>The&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/brain\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Stys Neuroscience Institute</em></a><em>&nbsp;at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital diagnoses and treats patients with a wide range of neurological conditions, from epilepsy to brain tumors and more.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>The coronavirus should have everyone&#39;s attention. And people with heart disease have extra reasons to be alert.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Eduardo Sanchez, MD, MPH, the American Heart Association&#39;s chief medical officer for prevention, it appears people over 65 with coronary heart disease or hypertension are more likely to be infected and to develop more severe symptoms. In February, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) issued a bulletin to warn patients about the potential increased risk and to encourage &quot;additional, reasonable precautions.&quot;</p><p>Based on early reports, 40% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease (which refers to blood flow in the brain, such as stroke), according to the bulletin. Different areas of the country are seeing different levels of virus activity, though the virus is now in every state, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advising those most at risk to stay home, to avoid crowds and to limit contact with others.&nbsp;</p><p>The virus could affect heart disease patients in several ways, said Orly Vardeny, MD, associate professor of medicine at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System and the University of Minnesota.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The virus&#39;s main target is the lungs. But that could affect the heart, especially a diseased heart, which has to work harder to get oxygenated blood throughout the body,&quot; said Vardeny, an adviser on the ACC bulletin. &quot;In general, you can think of it as something that is taxing the system as a whole.&quot;</p><p>That could exacerbate problems for someone with heart failure, where the heart is already having problems pumping efficiently.</p><p>Someone with an underlying heart issue also might have a less robust immune system. People&#39;s immune systems weaken as they age, Dr. Vardeny said. And &quot;in those with chronic medical conditions, the body&#39;s immune response is not as strong a response when exposed to viruses.&quot;</p><p>If such a person catches a virus, she said, it&#39;s likely to stick around and cause complications.</p><p>A virus also may pose a special risk for people who have the fatty buildup known as plaque in their arteries, Dr. Vardeny said. Evidence indicates similar viral illnesses can destabilize these plaques, potentially resulting in the blockage of an artery feeding blood to the heart, putting patients at risk of a heart attack.</p><p><strong>Past experience with SARS and MERS offers clues</strong></p><p>Dr. Vardeny emphasized that information about COVID-19 is changing almost hourly. But previous coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, offer insight. They were linked to problems such as inflammation of the heart muscle, heart attack and rapid-onset heart failure, the ACC bulletin said.</p><p>COVID-19 also has similarities to influenza, said Dr. Vardeny. At the moment, she said, &quot;We don&#39;t think the actual risk is any higher per se. It&#39;s just that the spread is quicker.&quot; And unlike the flu, there&#39;s no vaccine.</p><p>Many of the same precautions that work against the flu should be helpful against the new coronavirus, &nbsp;Dr. Vardeny said, because it appears to spread the same way &ndash; through droplets in the air when someone coughs or sneezes. People can defend themselves by following <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html\">CDC guidelines for COVID-19 prevention</a>.</p><p>The ACC bulletin said people with cardiovascular disease stay up to date with vaccinations, including for pneumonia. The ACC also supports getting a flu shot to prevent another source of fever, which could potentially be confused with the coronavirus infection.</p><p>The AHA has released some information regarding patients taking certain heart medications and the indications related to COVID-19.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Confession: I only half-listen to my husband when he starts rambling about sports, which has been a lot lately.&nbsp;</p><p>Second confession: I&rsquo;m not a good Catholic. Let me re-phrase. I&rsquo;m not a practicing Catholic. There is a difference. More on that later.</p><p>Confession three: my immune system is not perfect, so on March 18, it was recommended that I begin working from home due to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>On March 23, I developed a slight allergy-like cough, not so unusual for this time of year. But, because I work for a health system, I decided to be safe and isolate myself to protect others. The next day, my cough was gone, confirming it was as I suspected &ndash; seasonal allergies. It was also the day the world was waking up to great uncertainties. Fear manifested into a wide-spread hoarding of TP, soap and hand sanitizers. For self-preservation, I decided to stay in isolation.</p><p><strong>Four walls and &ldquo;The Diary of Anne Frank&rdquo;</strong></p><p>I read &ldquo;The Diary of Anne Frank&rdquo; in the 8th grade as an English class assignment. My book report was re-purposed as my catechism Lent project. Despite our differing religions, the lessons were surprisingly similar. Lent is introspection and self-discovery through sacrifice.&nbsp;</p><p>Reading her story as a teen, I was struck by Anne&rsquo;s description of early adulthood and her romantic ideals of the many life milestones she had before her. We all know the unfortunate ending. And how good versus evil will always exist, no matter how romantic or ideal you may wish it to be. Her sacrifice became a worldwide, multi-generational lesson for humanity, specifically how to forgive and respond gracefully to unfortunate circumstances.</p><p>My four walls became my hiding place as I watched my world shift to the edge of chaos. The first few days drove me crazy, and &ndash; another confession &ndash; I had a few ungraceful moments. Ask Bill, my husband, who can solidly confirm.</p><p><strong>Needful things</strong></p><p>Throughout the week, Bill and I keep a list of needed items. On Saturday mornings, before the rest of the world begins to stir, we start the store-to-store scavenger hunt, looking for specific products, often settling for something close-ish. It&rsquo;s the only time I allow myself to go out beyond the perimeter of our small gated community. Except for an occasional car ride to nowhere (it keeps me sane).</p><p>And then one Saturday morning, it happened; even though my world had become small, my life expanded.</p><p>Standing in the middle of the store aisle, I noticed that my world had shifted to a dystopia, where everything I did became a slow-mo tai chi moment, like the day I spent trying to get home to Michigan in time for my father&rsquo;s funeral. What was once normal was not anymore, and more noticeably, it&rsquo;s become okay if it isn&rsquo;t. Life continues. Making meaningful choices became a priority as I began checking through the necessary and unnecessary items in my life. I left the store that morning empty-handed, because I had, in fact, everything I needed.</p><p><strong>Lessons learned in the store aisle</strong></p><p>The world will not end if:</p><ul><li>I don&rsquo;t grab that deal for those pants, that handbag or those shoes.</li><li>My hair grows too long for my face shape, and (gasp) my roots begin to show.</li><li>Date night transforms into eating at home with a strange combination of left-overs and reruns of &ldquo;Frasier.&rdquo;</li><li>The daily news is limited, leaving more white space for peace and quiet.</li><li>A cell phone cannot possibly be my universe. Put it down.</li></ul><p>Your world will be full if:</p><ul><li>You enjoy quiet conversations with your husband during a walk at the end of the day, and be reminded why he is your best friend.</li><li>You take time to reflect on the day and find something to be thankful for.</li><li>You pick up the phone and reconnect with your family, specifically, in my case, my mom.</li></ul><p><strong>Being a good daughter</strong></p><p>Final confession; I am not a good daughter. Before my self-isolation, I called home once a month. Maybe. I was one of those kids who walked off the stage at high school graduation and left the small-town life behind. I needed to get lost in the world so I could find my own way.&nbsp;</p><p>It also was the time when I left the Catholic Church. Gen Xers are hallmarked by their self-absorption.</p><p>I spent the greater part of adulthood away from my family, developing a career in marketing. The irony is that in my profession, we highlight the lovely in ordinary moments; it helps us connect products or services to our audience. This is why my best ideas come from seemingly mundane moments, like making mashed potatoes for dinner or walking down the cereal aisle at the grocery store. I spent all this time paying attention to the vibe of the living without really living. True story.</p><p><strong>Silver lining</strong></p><p>Like Anne Frank, I was born into a religion that stays with you throughout life. The Catholic Church follows the Christian belief of redemption. It doesn&rsquo;t give up on you, even if you&rsquo;ve given up on it. Thus the distinction between a practicing and non-practicing Catholic. You&rsquo;re one or the other, for life. It stands there waiting for you with open arms. Just like family.</p><p>Truth is, the older I get, the more I need my small-town roots. After hearing that my mother is living in complete isolation as a COVID-19 precaution due to her age, I made a point to call her every Sunday so she has company on the day she misses my dad most.&nbsp;</p><p>I cherish the few hours of conversation with her on Sunday afternoons. She is the link to the person I am as an adult, and I have so many questions about her life that I need to know while she is here to tell it: What was it like to be a child during the Depression, and a teen during WWII? Did you know any of the orphans who were adopted by Polish-speaking families in your community after the war? When did you learn to drive a car? How did you meet dad?&nbsp;</p><p>Hearing her voice is reassuring and keeps my life in perspective. My mom will celebrate her 90th birthday in May. Anne Frank would have been 91 in June.</p><p>So here is my analysis of &ldquo;The COVID-19 Diary of Emilie P&quot;: Social distancing is also about giving people room to be themselves. And so I&rsquo;m kinder, more understanding, respectful and patient. I also found gratitude in a time of fear. The transformation helped me find my way home. I have what I need. And it&rsquo;s lovely.</p><p><em>At Baptist Health, we want to help keep you and your family informed about COVID-19.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Like many of you, my mind is a whirlwind of emotions when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic. I&rsquo;m concerned for my family and friends. But I&rsquo;m also frustrated, cooped up at home, watching the news and wondering what I can do to help my community, especially those in need.</p><p>So, I started thinking. I&rsquo;m staying in, maintaining distance when I have to go out, and washing my hands like 93 times a day. But I want to do more. Here are a few ideas I&rsquo;ve heard lately. I&rsquo;ve picked a couple that work for me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Help older neighbors.</strong> We all know that older people are more vulnerable if they get the virus. Many are not going anywhere at all to lower their risk. Reach out and offer to get groceries or pick up medications. You can leave them on their doorstep. Or you could offer to rake some leaves or run other necessary errands.</p><p><strong>Get your kids involved.</strong> Kids are the best at making colorful thank you notes with awesome drawings and sentiments that only kids think of. They can do this for whoever they&rsquo;d like to thank &ndash; their teachers, a neighbor, or anyone who needs their day brightened.</p><p><strong>Give blood.</strong> Hospitals are in need, but some people are afraid to give. The American Red Cross follows the highest standards of safety and infection control, and they encourage &ndash; no, they need &ndash; healthy people to donate blood or platelets during the pandemic.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t donated blood in about 20 years because it made me feel a little woozy. But wait; people really need it for survival. So I told myself, &ldquo;Suck it up, buttercup&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m doing it anyway. Plus, I hear they give you juice and cookies.</p><p><strong>Thank a health care worker.&nbsp;</strong>Anyone in the health care field &ndash; from those in hospitals to first responders and pharmacists -- could use a personal thank you these days. Send a text or email, or better yet, kick it old school and send a personal note. A handwritten thank you (remember those?) can touch a heart.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Thank other essential workers.&nbsp;</strong>Truck drivers, grocery store clerks, the police, mail carriers, sanitation workers, delivery people and others could use some heartfelt appreciation. I read a suggestion on Facebook to offer Gatorades or waters to your mail carrier or garbage collector, or anything you think may brighten their day. (Keep safety in mind.)</p><p><strong>Support local businesses.</strong> Ordering takeout is a great idea, but if you aren&rsquo;t comfortable with that, here are some other ideas. Consider writing a nice Yelp or Facebook review or see about ordering a gift certificate. Our housecleaning company offered that idea and I took them up on it.</p><p><strong>Support your local hospital.</strong> Baptist Health is looking for donations of commercial PPE, hand-sewn masks and isolation gowns, hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes. For more details about the Compassion for Caregivers campaign, including mask and gown patterns, go to the &quot;You Can Help&quot; section at <a href=\"http://baptistjax.com\">baptistjax.com</a>.</p><p><em>At Baptist Health, we want to help keep you and your family informed about COVID-19.

We&rsquo;ve agonized over paint colors (we went with lavender), chosen a theme for the nursery (secret garden), and tried to plan everything we could before new parenthood knocked us off our feet.</p><p><strong>We couldn&rsquo;t plan for COVID-19.</strong></p><p>My husband and I both work in health care: I&rsquo;m in the marketing and communications department at Baptist Health and he is a physician at another local hospital. I remember our conversations in the early days of COVID-19, both of us comparing it to the flu. We were wrong.</p><p>Thankfully, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/pregnancy-childbirth/covid-19-and-pregnancy\" target=\"_blank\">experts say</a> pregnant women don&rsquo;t seem to be getting infected with COVID-19 any more frequently than their non-pregnant counterparts, and studies have not shown COVID-19 to be passed from mother to unborn child.</p><p>Still, in a matter of weeks, I have watched the world change around me, trying to adjust my plans and expectations along the way.</p><p><strong>Finding light&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I kept a smile on my face this entire time. When my parents, who are both over the age of 65 and live in hard-hit Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, told me they likely wouldn&rsquo;t be able to come down for the birth, I cried. A lot. I cried even more when they explained that it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re afraid of getting us sick &ndash; my mom is a nurse who still reports to the hospital &ndash; not the other way around.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Juliette Allen\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1585846662/Juice/img_9087.jpg\"></div><p>I cried again when I packed a bag for the hospital, full of the softest and cutest newborn clothes I&rsquo;ve ever seen, knowing my mom had meticulously chosen them and she wouldn&rsquo;t get to see them on her first grandchild in person.</p><p>But I know this is right. This is what we need to do for the greater good, to prevent this horrid virus from spreading further and putting more peoples&rsquo; lives at stake.</p><p>So I choose to find the bright spots.</p><p>Before the COVID craziness hit, we celebrated our baby girl with not one, but three showers thrown by family, friends and coworkers. Many other pregnant women I know did not have that chance, and have had to cancel or postpone celebrations. We are so lucky.</p><p>Baptist Health allows Labor and Delivery patients to have one spouse/partner or other designated person in the room for the delivery. I won&rsquo;t have to be alone. We are so lucky.</p><p>Every time I feel a tiny foot (or is it an elbow?) jab me in my stomach, I am reminded that I am able to carry a baby. We are so lucky.</p><p><strong>Ready or not, here she comes</strong></p><p>Truthfully, I&rsquo;m a little scared, but I think we all are. What I&rsquo;ve come to embrace is that I have to take things one day at a time. But that&rsquo;s parenthood, too, right? Maybe this has been the best practice of all!</p><p>In the next three weeks, I&rsquo;ll spend time YouTube-ing breathing techniques, reading &ldquo;What to Expect,&rdquo; and counting down to what will undoubtedly be, no matter what, the best day of my life.</p><p>And to my fellow moms-to-be: stay strong mamas; we&rsquo;ve got this.</p><p><em>Although Baptist Health has had to cancel in-person Maternity and New Baby Classes for the time being, we have set up <strong>free</strong>, virtual classes to help parents-to-be get ready for the big day.

But how much muscle can you build in your living room, really? Turns out you can accomplish quite a bit in your house, around the block, and with household items while waiting for the COVID-19 curve to flatten.</p><p>Mary Beth Torres, MS, RDN, senior health and wellness consultant with Baptist Health&rsquo;s Healthy For Life employee wellness program, says it&rsquo;s vital for everyone to keep moving during a quarantine.</p><p>&ldquo;The No. 1 benefit of being physically active is to improve on your mental and emotional health during these times,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re humans and we&rsquo;re used to being social, so being socially isolated can really put people in the wrong mindset. Being active, even though we can&rsquo;t be out and about, really helps stimulate the brain and senses to keep us in a happier place.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>For class addicts seeking Zumba, yoga, and more</strong></p><p>For those who usually get their exercise at gym classes or through team sports, Torres recommends finding guided workouts through your streaming service of choice.</p><p>&ldquo;Streaming services have a lot of on-demand classes; Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hulu all have a ton of yoga, cycling, HIIT, cardio and Zumba-style dance classes similar to the ones you&rsquo;d take at your gym. Also, our local YMCAs are moving their classes online, offering <a href=\"https://fcymca.org/new-virtual-services/\" target=\"_blank\">free, live virtual classes</a> for members and nonmembers.&rdquo;</p><p>You can also find them on your smartphone. Torres&rsquo; favorite apps include MyFitnessPal, Workout Women and 7-Minute Workout.</p><p><strong>Keeping it simple</strong></p><p>Having expert-guided workouts can help beginners get moving without feeling overwhelmed, but even without apps, just doing basic movements throughout your day can help you reap some fitness benefits.</p><p>&ldquo;Do simple things like sit-ups, pushups and squats. Even if you&rsquo;re working from home remotely, just stand up and sit down in your chair,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><strong>Upping the ante with household items</strong></p><p>For gym lovers who need more challenge than just using their own body weight, look around the house and see what you can use as equipment. Toss all those canned goods in a backpack and do some curls, for example.</p><p>&ldquo;I saw a really fun video about a family who made a backyard obstacle course with their children, and they filled a backpack with bags of flour and used the backpack on their back to exercise while doing it. You could also sit down and lift it like a dumbbell. Cans of food can be used as weights as well, or if you need more weight, put it in something easy to use as a dumbbell.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Getting outside is A-OK</strong></p><p>Torres also encourages people not to fear going outdoors. Since social distancing focuses on giving each other space, just be mindful of your proximity to others, and try to avoid touching items and your face until you can wash your hands after returning home.</p><p>&ldquo;Having fresh air is good for your mental and emotional health,&rdquo; Torres said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re working out outside, stay six feet apart. Make sure whatever you&rsquo;re touching, don&rsquo;t touch your face and immediately wash your hands and the knobs you used to walk in and out. People should not be afraid to go outside &mdash; go get a good dose of vitamin D and fresh air.&rdquo;</p><p>Lastly, Torres said it&rsquo;s easy to forget about fitness when your usual schedule is disrupted. When you create a new daily schedule to work (and do school work with the kids) from home, build exercise into it, too.</p><p>&ldquo;Make it a priority. If you don&rsquo;t it won&rsquo;t happen, so make sure you put it on the schedule,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><em>At Baptist Health, we want to help keep you and your family informed about COVID-19.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Like millions of Americans during the COVID-19 crisis, this is week two of my work-from-home adventure. As a marketing and communications specialist for Baptist Health, I&rsquo;m fortunate my job translates easily to a home environment. A laptop and a phone, along with a quiet space, are pretty much all I need. Sounds easy enough, huh?</p><p>Spoiler alert: I&rsquo;ve had a few challenges.</p><p>First, there&rsquo;s my hubby, the banking executive. Apparently, the banking industry is impacted, too, and there are a lot of conference calls needed. Oh, and they ALL have to be on speaker phone.</p><p>And, we have two kids &ndash; age 17 and 20&mdash;here at Casa Stambaugh doing their online studies. Our house is medium-sized, but seems smaller (and louder) with four adults shuffling around trying to get their work done.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve found that works (and doesn&rsquo;t work) for me:</p><p><strong>Make an &ldquo;office&rdquo;</strong><br>Working on the couch with your laptop and the news on does not work. At all. You need a workspace of your own. We don&rsquo;t have a home office, so we&rsquo;ve had to create our own private spaces. I staked out the dining room -- prime real estate. Hubby the banking exec is at the kitchen table. The kiddos apparently can work from their beds.</p><p><strong>Put on your big girl or big boy pants and deal with the technical issues.</strong><br>If working from home is new to you, chances are you&rsquo;ll face some technical hurdles. Turns out, I needed more than just a laptop and phone &ndash; a printer is needed too. I had an old one that had been serving as a table collecting dust. Plugging it in, I discovered, of course, that it needed new ink cartridges. This happens every time you want to use a home printer. It&rsquo;s a law of the universe.</p><p>I successfully got the cartridges at the office supply store and was comforted to see other work-from-homers wandering idly down the aisles like zombies. We&rsquo;re all in this together!</p><p>When I got home, there was NOWHERE on the device to put the cartridges. Befuddled, my son told me to &ldquo;YouTube&rdquo; it. &nbsp;The video led me through step by step. Who knew I was a technical genius?</p><p>The only other hurdle was not being able to sync my work laptop to my home computer &ndash; something about security, according to the guy at our help desk. Easy fix &ndash; fire up your super old personal laptop, map it to the printer, and 27 cusswords later, you are all set. All you have to do is email the document you need printed to yourself and print from your home computer. Voila!</p><p><strong>Find ways to connect with coworkers</strong><br>Most of us are social, and if not, we are at least accustomed to being in an environment with others. I miss my team members. I don&rsquo;t have anyone to brainstorm with to get the creative juices flowing. So, I&rsquo;ve taken drastic measures. I actually pick up the phone and talk to a living and breathing coworker. Hearing their voices, and better yet, seeing them via Zoom or FaceTime, can help recharge your batteries and get you past work challenges you may not be able to figure out on your own.</p><p><strong>Rules are optional</strong><br>Many people have rules that work for them, like: &ldquo;Take a shower, get dressed, wear deodorant, blah, blah, blah.&rdquo; For me, whatever works, works. Some days I look presentable and other days not so much. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, as long as you&rsquo;re getting the work done.</p><p>(Unless there&rsquo;s a Zoom meeting; then you may want to reconsider the tie-die T-shirt and plaid PJ pants at 4 pm.)</p><p><strong>Puffy Cheetos are not your friend</strong><br>I said it. Light, crunchy and cheesy seem like a nice little work snack until you eat the entire bag. This is not good, from what I have read. &ldquo;Have healthy snacks at your fingertips,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;Apples and bananas,&rdquo; they say. Again, do what works for you. The entire world is blowing up. So, I am changing my mind. Eat the Cheetos.</p><p><strong>Realize you&rsquo;re in a good spot</strong><br>If you&rsquo;re working from home, you&rsquo;re likely safe, and keeping your distance from others. You&rsquo;re doing your part and you&rsquo;re getting to do it from the comfort of home.</p><p>Get some perspective: Many of my friends at Baptist Health are literally on the front lines fighting this virus, like so many others. You can do this.</p><p><em>At Baptist Health, we want to help keep you and your family informed about COVID-19.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Can you relate to all the #quarantinesnacks memes floating around on Facebook? Working and going to school from home mean the fridge is always just a few steps away and mealtime routines are shot, so it makes sense if you&rsquo;re tempted to eat more than usual (and maybe not the healthiest foods, either, since you probably stocked up on extra goodies for social distancing).</p><p>&ldquo;Being at home takes away from that structure adults and children are accustomed to,&rdquo; said Diana Rosito, wellness coach at the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/y-healthy-living-centers/northside-dunn-ave\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist North Y Healthy Living Center</a>. &ldquo;A good way of working through temptation is to maintain structure by creating a schedule for you and the kids. Incorporate a mid-morning and mid-afternoon snack times into your schedule.&rdquo;</p><p>You can also portion out your snacks in advance so they&rsquo;re (1). not going to throw off your nutrition plan, and (2) easy to grab and go while you&rsquo;re working and helping your kiddos with school work. Making healthy options easier to eat means you&rsquo;re all the more likely to reach for the apples and peanut butter over the chips since they&rsquo;re just as convenient.</p><p>Rosito recommends:</p><ul><li>Hummus and carrots (or strawberries with &ldquo;chocolate hummus&rdquo; to satisfy a sweet tooth)</li><li>String cheese</li><li>Unsalted nuts</li><li>Veggie chips</li><li>Banana and peanut butter</li><li>Grapes</li><li>Rice cakes with peanut butter</li><li>Light-butter popcorn</li></ul><p>Fruits and veggies are healthy, of course, but now isn&rsquo;t the time to be at the grocery store every few days. While social-distancing precautions are in place, what are some wellness coach-recommended snacks that will also keep well in the pantry? Rosito suggests unsalted nuts, whole wheat crackers, dried fruit, peanut butter and rice cakes.</p><p>And while a balanced diet is always important for health, eating nutritious foods to boost your immunity takes on extra importance during uncertain times like the COVID-19 situation.</p><p>&ldquo;The healthiest meals emphasize whole grains, vegetables and fruits, so serve those in the greatest amounts,&rdquo; Rosito says. &ldquo;Meat portions should be smaller; this will save money and help keep dietary saturated fat in check. Stick with things that are packed with nutrition as much as possible. Try to limit consumption of tempting foods such as chips, cookies, ice cream and sodas. They are full of empty calories and run up your grocery bill.&rdquo;</p><p>Staying hydrated is key, too. Rosito says to take your body weight and divide it in half &mdash; that&rsquo;s how many ounces you should be drinking each day.</p><p>&ldquo;A good to way to boost your immune system is to get in some extra Vitamin C. Drinking an Emergen-C&reg; once a day is not such a bad idea during this pandemic,&rdquo; she adds.</p><p>At Baptist Health, we want to help keep you and your family informed about COVID-19.

It involves limiting your interactions with others, taking your temperature regularly, and checking for symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough, fever and shortness of breath. You should self-monitor for 14 days following the point at which you think you could have been exposed.</li><li><strong>Self-quarantining&nbsp;</strong>separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. This should be done if you have been in direct contact with someone who is infected. For example, if a person who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 has coughed or sneezed near you, or you live with a person who has been diagnosed, you should self-quarantine for 14 days.</li><li><strong>Self-isolating</strong> separates sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick. This is for people who have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been diagnosed. It means staying indoors and completely avoiding contact with other people. If you live with others, stay in a separate bedroom and use a different bathroom than others.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Coronavirus is all anyone can talk about right now, and for good reason. Besides how much it has changed our daily lives, every time the world learns something new about COVID-19, it seems to bring up more questions. This is especially true for pregnant women wondering how this new virus might affect them or their babies. While the international medical community doesn&rsquo;t know everything about this virus (yet), there are steps expectant moms can take to stay safe.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/obstetrician-and-gynecologist/dr-samuel-new-md\" target=\"_blank\">S. Brandon New, MD</a>, an obstetrician with North Florida OB/GYN and Baptist Health, shares with Juice what doctors know about coronavirus, what they don&rsquo;t know, and what parents and parents-to-be should do to protect themselves and their new additions.</p><p><strong>Are pregnant women more likely to catch the virus, and what are their risks if they do?</strong></p><p>Pregnant women are often categorized as immunocompromised, a population of patients that can get infections more frequently and with greater adverse effects. However, Dr. New said that so far, pregnant women don&rsquo;t seem to be getting infected with COVID-19 any more frequently than women of similar age and health who aren&rsquo;t pregnant.</p><p>&ldquo;So far, being pregnant doesn&rsquo;t seem to be as big of a factor with this particular virus as it has with others,&rdquo; said Dr. New. &ldquo;Pregnant women seem to be responding the same as nonpregnant women, so it&rsquo;s at least not worse, but it&rsquo;s still a dangerous virus.&rdquo;</p><p>That said, expectant moms and their partners should still take the necessary precautions to avoid exposure.</p><p>&ldquo;We have to respect the potential of this virus and what we know about the vulnerabilities of the pregnant state. Pregnancy is associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary physiologic changes. The mother&rsquo;s heart and lungs adapt to accommodate the growing pregnancy, leaving her with fewer reserves to fight such illness.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>If I get coronavirus, will it spread to my baby? What are the effects?</strong></p><p>Dr. New cited an advisory from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), which referenced a study of nine COVID-19-positive women who gave birth in China. None of their babies had the virus. It also wasn&rsquo;t present in the babies&rsquo; cord blood or amniotic fluid, or their mothers&rsquo; breast milk.</p><p>&ldquo;From the limited data we have, it seems the rate of transmission is going to be low. What we don&rsquo;t know is exactly where that transmission rate lies, or if it varies by the time period the mother was infected. With certain viruses, the transmission rates are higher if the exposure is in the first trimester, and others are worse in the third trimester,&rdquo; Dr. New said.</p><p>There&rsquo;s currently no data on risks to unborn and newborn babies from the virus.</p><p><strong>What should I do to avoid catching coronavirus?</strong></p><p>Of course, the CDC recommends washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before eating, after going to the bathroom, and after blowing your nose, sneezing or coughing. Also, they say not to touch your face, especially your eyes, nose and mouth.</p><p>When it comes to preventing the spread of coronavirus or catching it yourself, Dr. New said to also stick to these simple guidelines:</p><ul><li>Prioritize prevention. &ldquo;Take prevention very seriously. Any kind of activity out of the home or with others should be limited or avoided completely for now. If you do need to go to the grocery store, you need to be taking the hand hygiene precautions and the six-foot social distancing barrier, and cleaning your surfaces when you get home.&rdquo;</li><li>Be vigilant. &ldquo;Monitor for symptoms. I tell patients to periodically check their temperature, especially if they&rsquo;re feeling ill. It&rsquo;s important for patients to be vigilant not only with symptoms but objective data, like checking your temperature at home, something easy everyone can do.&rdquo;</li><li>Support your immune system. &ldquo;Take general health measures to keep your immune system as strong as it can be. The weather is temperate right now, so you can get out and exercise. Stay hydrated. Eat healthy foods with plenty of antioxidants. Optimize your immune system as much as possible.&rdquo;</li><li>Call your doctor with questions or concerns. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not alone. There are web-based resources all over, but we&rsquo;re only a call away, and we&rsquo;d much rather field calls than have patients worry, or worse, ignore a serious symptom. If you do have symptoms and need to be screened, use measures to prevent spread to others by making the proper calls before coming in to be seen.&rdquo;</li></ul><p><em>At Baptist Health, we want to help keep you and your family informed about COVID-19.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Timothy Parenton, 58, head coach of the University of North Florida&rsquo;s baseball team, had a sore throat. It was February 2019, and colds were common for him that time of year as he breathed in the damp, cooler air during practices and games, so he didn&rsquo;t think much of it. He went to <a href=\"https://www.carespot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CareSpot Urgent Care</a>, got some antibiotics and thought they would knock the illness out.</p><p>But 11 days later, his throat was still sore. His wife, Shelia, told him he needed to see an ear, nose and throat physician. <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-ent-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist ENT Specialists</a> ordered a biopsy, which revealed stage II throat cancer. Parenton was immediately referred to <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/surgical-oncologist/dr-russell-smith-md#utm_source=juice&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=juice&utm_term=juice&utm_content=juice\" target=\"_blank\">Russell Smith, MD,</a> head and neck surgical oncologist at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center#utm_source=juice&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=juice&utm_term=juice&utm_content=juice\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;What a blessing it was to be treated by Baptist MD Anderson,&rdquo; Parenton said. &ldquo;From my first day there onward, I did whatever my physicians told me to do. I&rsquo;ve coached baseball for 29 years, and I played football and baseball at Mississippi State. I grew up listening to my coaches and doing what they said, and that&rsquo;s how I wanted to approach this.&rdquo;</p><p>Parenton wanted to listen to the advice of his doctors and follow in the footsteps of his brother, who had beaten colon cancer 10 years before.</p><p><strong>A multi-disciplinary approach</strong></p><p>To prepare for chemotherapy and radiation to treat his throat cancer, Parenton saw many other members of the head and neck cancer multidisciplinary team. This included a speech-language pathologist, dietitians, and a dentist.</p><p>Parenton&rsquo;s treatment plan included getting chemotherapy once a week and radiation therapy five days a week. He began chemotherapy on Mondays, the one day his baseball team has off during the season, and scheduled his radiation early in the morning Monday through Friday so he could head straight to practice from there.</p><p>His wife, who supported him throughout his cancer journey, insisted on driving him in for chemotherapy every Monday. Throughout six rounds of chemo and seven weeks of radiation, Parenton only missed one baseball game.</p><p>&ldquo;I really believe that remaining active and being around young athletes helped me to stay positive,&rdquo; Parenton said. &ldquo;I wanted to show the team that I was not going to give in.&rdquo;</p><p>Parenton&rsquo;s assistant coaches and the team&rsquo;s trainer stepped up to help him out during treatment, and he kept them and the team updated about how his treatment was progressing.</p><p><strong>Moving forward</strong></p><p>After completing chemotherapy and radiation, Parenton had a CT and PET scan in September 2019 to make sure all of the cancer had been destroyed by the treatment. There were some small lymph nodes remaining in the right side of his neck. Dr. Smith gave him the option of waiting to see if the lymph nodes slowly went away or surgically removing them to check for cancer. Parenton opted to get the nodes removed to make sure he was cancer-free.</p><p>Test results after the surgery came back negative. While Parenton will continue to be monitored, he doesn&rsquo;t need any further treatment at this time. Parenton said the evolution in cancer treatment options gave him hope. His dad passed away from cancer in 1997 after it metastasized throughout his body, and the available treatments at that time were not as sophisticated.</p><p>&ldquo;I know that every day, the medical field is doing everything it can to cure cancer,&rdquo; Parenton said. &ldquo;Ten to 15 years ago, I don&rsquo;t know if I would have had the same positive attitude and outcome. But, when I heard people ring that bell after they completed treatment, it kept me going.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you need a cancer specialist or have questions about our&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center/head-and-neck-cancer#utm_source=juice&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=juice&utm_term=juice&utm_content=juice\" target=\"_blank\"><em>head and neck cancer clinic</em></a><em>&nbsp;at Baptist MD Anderson, please call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"tel:1-904-202-7300\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.202.7300</em></a><em>&nbsp;or visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center#utm_source=juice&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=juice&utm_term=juice&utm_content=juice\" target=\"_blank\"><em>BaptistMDAnderson.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

Sometimes it&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the lingo.</p><p>&ldquo;These terms are becoming part of our everyday lexicon,&rdquo; said David Rice, MD, senior vice president and chief quality officer for Baptist Health. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to understand them so we can comply with what health authorities are saying, and hopefully, move us closer to controlling the virus,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a quick glossary of some recent buzzwords:</p><p><strong>COVID-19 &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>We know what it means, but where did the letters come from? The acronym stands for &quot;CO-rona VI-rus D-isease.&quot; The 19 is used to designate the year in which it first appeared: 2019.</p><p><strong>Novel coronavirus &ndash;</strong> Nope, it&rsquo;s not a bestselling book. A novel (new) coronavirus is a respiratory condition named SARS-CoV2 and is part of the same large virus family that causes the common cold. (In fact, COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV2 and novel coronavirus all refer to the current virus.)</p><p><strong>Flattening the curve &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>Taking protective measures to slow the rate of infection so that hospitals will have rooms, doctors and supplies to treat patients is referred to as &quot;flattening the curve.&quot; The goal is to prevent surges in illness. Protective measures include staying at home, handwashing, social distancing and cleaning high-touch surfaces.</p><div class=\"u-size4of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Flattening_the_Curve\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1585229987/Juice/flattening_the_curve_final.gif\"></div><p><em>Source: CDC</em></p><p><strong>Social Distancing &ndash;</strong> Health officials have instructed the public to practice social distancing &ndash; staying home, avoiding crowds and refraining from being in close contact to reduce opportunities for the spread of the coronavirus. When near others, social distancing means staying at least 6 feet apart. Social distancing helps &quot;flatten the curve&quot; and reduce infection among high-risk populations.</p><p><strong>Pandemic &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>An epidemic that has become a global phenomenon. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Pandemics happen when a new virus emerges to infect people and can spread world-wide because there is no pre-existing immunity.</p><p><strong>PPE &ndash;</strong> Stands for personal protective equipment that health care workers must wear to protect themselves from the virus, such as masks, gowns, face shields, head covers, goggles and shoe covers.</p><p><strong>Incubation &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>The time between catching the virus and having symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 2-14 days, most commonly around five days. This means that you can still be contagious if you are not showing symptoms! This takes us back to the importance of social distancing to flatten the curve.</p><p><em>At Baptist Health, we want to help keep you and your family informed about COVID-19.

Screening also helps us determine what infection prevention measures need to be put into place.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Screening</strong></p><p>Hospitals across the United States, including Baptist Health, are following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of Health guidelines for screening patients to see whether they are at-risk for COVID-19. While guidelines are changing as the COVID-19 crisis unfolds, currently, in order to be tested for the disease, a patient must first <em>screen</em> positive. To limit exposure, screening is often done over the phone or via <a href=\"https://telescopehealth.com/\" target=\"_blank\">telehealth consult</a>. Screening takes place in the <a href=\"https://www.baptistcarenow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Emergency Room</a> if a person&rsquo;s symptoms are severe.</p><p>Screening questions include:</p><ul><li>Does the person have symptoms like fever, cough and/or shortness of breath?</li><li>Has the person traveled to any of the countries <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">listed by the CDC</a> as having widespread or sustained community transmission?</li><li>Has the person come into contact with anyone who has confirmed or suspected COVID-19?</li></ul><p><strong>Testing</strong></p><p>If a person <em>screens</em> positive, he or she may be <em>tested</em> for COVID-19. If a patient meets Florida Department of Health (FDOH) criteria to be tested for COVID-19, the sample will sent to an FDOH lab. If a patient does not meet criteria, but the provider considers that COVID-19 testing is indicated, a sample may be collected and sent to a commercial lab for testing.</p><p>In an effort to make testing more accessible, Baptist Health, the City of Jacksonville and Telescope Health recently collaborated to establish a <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/city-of-jacksonville-adds-covid-19-drive-thru-testing-site-in-collaboration-with-baptist-health-and-telescope-health\" target=\"_blank\">Drive-Thru Testing Site</a> for Duval County residents who have completed a Telescope Health virtual visit and been referred to testing by a physician.</p><p><strong>Have questions?

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>You have heard and read a lot about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory condition caused by a novel (new) coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is part of the same large virus family that causes the common cold. However, the newest coronavirus had led to a pandemic, and as with any crisis, there are facts and there are myths. Baptist Health experts break them down.</p><p><strong>MYTH: Children are more susceptible to COVID-19.</strong></p><p>Based on the evidence available, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. In fact, adults make up most of the known cases today. The CDC is updating a Risk Assessment page to learn more about who is most at risk for health problems if they have COVID-19. &nbsp;Children can spread the infection to other high-risk individuals, even if they&#39;re not showing symptoms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FACT: WHO let the dogs out?</strong></p><p>There&rsquo;s no evidence that pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).</p><p>Scientists concluded that cats and dogs can test positive for low levels of the virus if they catch it from their owners, but pets can&rsquo;t get sick from the virus.</p><p><strong>MYTH: I can&rsquo;t spread the virus; I don&rsquo;t have symptoms.</strong></p><p>People are most contagious when they have the symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath) but some spread might be possible before people even show symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>&ldquo;The virus spreads primarily from person-to-person from those who are within about 6 feet of one another,&rdquo; said Mobeen Rathore, MD, a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Baptist Health and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. &ldquo;It is spread through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>FACT: I should wear a mask, even if I&rsquo;m healthy.</strong></p><p>While early messages did not encourage healthy individuals to wear a mask, the CDC has released <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\" target=\"_blank\">new guidance</a> that people should wear a face covering in public, especially in areas with groups or where appropriate social distancing cannot be maintained. Surgical and respirator masks should be reserved for front-line health care workers but wearing homemade masks or bandannas in public will help reduce your droplets to others.</p><p><strong>FACT: Baptist Health is ready!</strong></p><p>Brett McClung, president and CEO of Baptist Health, wrote to our community, &ldquo;Year-round we drill, refine our processes, prepare, test, and then prepare some more. We are in a continual state of readiness for public health emergencies.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/community-health/message-to-the-community-about-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\">Read more from McClung</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>For more information, visit b<a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/Covid19\" target=\"_blank\">aptistjax.com/covid19&nbsp;</a>or if you have questions about COVID symptoms, call <a href=\"tel:1-904-302-5050\" target=\"_blank\">904.302.5050</a>.</em></p>",

For him, and so many others of his generation, cigarettes were a way to relax and forget the things they had seen during the war.</p><p>Shuss, who is now 74, was also exposed to Agent Orange while he was in Vietnam and has experienced his share of health struggles.

Dr. Putnam gave Shuss two options: 1) biopsy the nodule and discuss next steps or 2) proceed with surgery to remove it.

Because of this process, everyone was in place and ready by the time Carlos arrived at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;I really applaud the team at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Emergency Center at Baptist South who recognized the symptoms as a potential stroke and acted immediately,&rdquo; said Dr. Abram. &ldquo;It saved time, which is so critical when a patient of any age is having a stroke.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Super -perfect&rdquo; circumstances</strong></p><p>Time was particularly important in this case because Dr. Abram knew Carlos could be an ideal candidate to receive the blood clot-busting medication, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which is commonly used in adults but rarely in children.</p><p>&ldquo;The circumstances have to be just perfect to give it to an adult, and to give it to a child, it has to be super-perfect,&rdquo; said Dr. Abram. &nbsp;&ldquo;All the cards have to line up and the pieces have to fall into place perfectly.&rdquo;</p><p>A child has to be given intravenous tPA within 4-1/2 hours of the onset of stroke. Due to the public perception that children don&rsquo;t have strokes, Dr. Abram said many parents will wait to seek emergency care for their child. In this case, though, Carlos&rsquo; father and care team immediately recognized the symptoms and acted quickly, which allowed him to qualify for the treatment.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the first time we have given tPA to a child at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, and it&rsquo;s only been given to a child 25 or so times in the U.S.,&rdquo; said Dr. Abram. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a one-hour infusion, and 45 minutes into it, Carlos&rsquo; vision had completely returned to normal and he could move his left arm.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Heart of the matter</strong></p><p>Although Carlos&rsquo; symptoms improved, the biggest question remained: what caused the stroke? As part of the process to figure that out, <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-cardiologist/dr-jose-ettedgui-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jose Ettedgui, MD</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/heart\" target=\"_blank\">pediatric cardiologist</a> with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville, and <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/heart/heart-team\" target=\"_blank\">medical director</a> of the Terry Heart Center at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, performed an echocardiogram, a test that creates images of the heart.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Heart\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1583340569/Juice/13_yo_stroke_pt_heart_secondary_image.jpg\"></div><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a naturally existing hole in the wall of the heart before birth that, with the change in the dynamics of blood flow from being inside the womb to being in the outside world, should seal off once a baby is born,&rdquo; said Dr. Ettedgui. &ldquo;When the hole doesn&rsquo;t close, it&rsquo;s called patent foramen ovale (PFO). Through testing, we found that Carlos has PFO.&rdquo;</p><p>While the term &ldquo;hole in the heart&rdquo; sounds scary, Dr. Ettedgui said PFO is relatively common, occurring in 20-25% of people, with the vast majority having no major problems from the condition. In Carlos&rsquo; case, however, the hole may have allowed a blood clot to travel straight to the brain, causing the stroke.</p><p>&ldquo;The hole is just the pathway,&rdquo; said Dr. Ettedgui. &ldquo;What can happen is, somewhere in the deep veins of the leg or pelvis, a very small blood clot is produced. As that clot is traveling through the bloodstream, if it goes through the heart at just the right time, it can go from the right side, through the hole and then to the left side. Once it&rsquo;s on the left side, the majority of blood flow ejected from the heart goes north to the brain. That can cause a stroke.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Ettedgui performed a minimally invasive procedure to insert a wire mesh patch to close off the hole in the heart in February 2020. He said it should be the only procedure Carlos will need.</p><p>&ldquo;Once the device has been implanted, after the first six months or so, the cells that form the inner layer of the heart will grow over it,&rdquo; said Dr. Ettedgui. &ldquo;It acts as a framework for the heart to finish healing itself.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Getting back in the game</strong></p><p>After the stroke, Carlos spent one night in the PICU before being transferred to the Neuroscience floor of Wolfson Children&rsquo;s for three more nights. In the long run, Carlos will be able to return to the baseball diamond about a month after his heart procedure, though he will initially need to wear a helmet at all times due to blood thinners he is taking.</p><p>While Carlos&rsquo; father is still coming to grips with what he calls a roller coaster of events, he is grateful for the fast actions that set Carlos up for the best outcome possible.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so appreciative of the way both the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Emergency Center at Baptist South and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital acted so quickly to get Carlos into the position to receive the tPA,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>For Dr. Abram, Carlos&rsquo; story is a reminder to parents that, while rare, strokes do happen in children.</p><p>&ldquo;Most of what we do in neurology is after the fact. We see a child after they&rsquo;ve been in a car accident, after they&rsquo;ve had meningitis, or a couple days after a stroke, and we really can&rsquo;t do much. We just support the parents and do the best we can,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So for us to be able to go in there and really make a difference at the time of the stroke with revolutionary medicine is a really rewarding for the whole team.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Minutes matter when your child is having a health emergency, which is why Wolfson Children&rsquo;s has six Emergency Centers located throughout the Northeast Florida area.

Turns out, there are other health concerns that can cause similar symptoms.</p><p>&ldquo;We highly discourage self-diagnosis because there have been studies that have shown you&rsquo;re not always accurate,&rdquo; said Dr. Guha. &ldquo;Monistat&reg; will take care of it, and many times it does, but suppose it isn&rsquo;t a yeast infection? Then it&rsquo;s not going to help and antifungal medication will make things worse. It could be that you&rsquo;re having an allergic reaction to something, which I see all the time.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Beware the beast getting bigger</strong></p><p>If left untreated, a yeast infection and similar conditions can turn into something more bothersome, said Dr. Guha. In some patients, the infection can progress to the skin of the vulva and cause irritation and inflammation, known as vulvitis.</p><p>&ldquo;Also, in diabetic patients, it can cause a yeast urinary tract infection if you have [a yeast infection] for a long time. Chronic yeast infections on the vulva, if you don&rsquo;t treat them, can progress to a chronic vulvar skin condition. It can also trigger spasms of the pelvic floor muscles and vulvar pain conditions, which can lead to painful sexual intercourse.&rdquo;</p><p>So, not like you needed more incentive to treat a yeast infection, but there you have it. What&rsquo;s the best method to do just that? Simply using an antifungal cream or oral antifungal medicines from the pharmacy should do the trick. If it doesn&rsquo;t clear up as expected, checking in with your physician is the next step.</p><p><strong>Is the beast afraid of anything?</strong></p><p>As always, prevention is the best medicine. Most of what we think we know about yeast infections doesn&rsquo;t have much data to support it. However, following these steps may help keep the yeast beast at bay.</p><p>&ldquo;There is a misconception that taking probiotics orally or as suppositories will prevent yeast infections. Sometimes people take it before and after antibiotic use, but there&rsquo;s not enough evidence that it actually helps. Some people think there&rsquo;s a link between yeast infections and douching, using tampons versus pads, and wearing tight or synthetic clothing. The evidence behind those associations is weak. Those things are not good for your vulvar hygiene anyway, so we&rsquo;d recommend not doing them, but whether they actually cause a yeast infection is debatable,&rdquo; explained Dr. Guha.</p><p>So, while there&rsquo;s not a ton of research to support whether or not tight clothes or probiotics have any effect on yeast infections, it can&rsquo;t hurt to be mindful of those things anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;In general, practice overall vulvar hygiene like not douching, not wearing tight clothing and not wearing swimsuits for an extended time. Use of vaginal sponges, diaphragms and IUDs are also associated with yeast infection but it&rsquo;s not consistent, so not all women with IUDs will get yeast infections, but some women are more prone once they have an IUD.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Who does it bother?</strong></p><p>While any girl or woman can experience a yeast infection, some are more prone to them than others.</p><p>&ldquo;A patient with diabetes or any kind of chronic illness that decreases your immunity, or a patient on immunosuppressant medication, has a higher risk,&rdquo; Dr. Guha said. &ldquo;Antibiotic use is a very common thing we see causing yeast infections, and also estrogen therapy, like being on an oral contraceptive.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you are experiencing symptoms of a yeast infection, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/4her-wellness-resources\" target=\"_blank\"><em>4Her</em></a><em>&nbsp;or call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"tel:1-904-202-4437\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.202.4HER (4437)</em></a><em>&nbsp;to find the right provider for you and make an appointment.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>For more women&#39;s health information, download the <a href=\"https://go.onelink.me/ROPj/MFBjuice\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health MyFamily app</a>.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>It breaks a parent&rsquo;s heart to see his or her child whimpering, shivering or struggling through a fever. It&rsquo;s easy to fall into panic as your mind races to all the possibilities that could be causing your little one discomfort.</p><p>Fevers are one of the most common reasons parents take children to one of six <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/emergency\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital Emergency Centers</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-emergency-medicine-specialist/dr-brian-gilligan-md\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Gilligan, MD</a>, pediatric emergency medicine physician with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and Emergency Resources Group, says not every fever warrants that kind of worry.</p><p><strong>Fever 101</strong></p><p>A fever is a body temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher, according to Dr. Gilligan. Fevers are most commonly caused by viral or bacterial infections, so when a child has a fever, the most pressing concern is the infection itself, not the resulting fever.</p><p>&ldquo;Our goal with fever reduction is to make the child comfortable and to prevent excessive fluid loss and dehydration,&rdquo; said Dr. Gilligan. &ldquo;Fever is the body&rsquo;s normal response when we are sick and it also helps with resolution of viral and bacterial illnesses. Occasionally in children, a rapid rise in body temperature can cause a seizure, known as a febrile seizure. While scary, these are quite harmless and generally do not cause any short- nor long-term problems.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>When to worry</strong></p><p>The medical response to a child&rsquo;s fever depends largely on age. Dr. Gilligan outlined some key points for parents to determine whether to take their child to the nearest Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Emergency Center or call/visit the pediatrician.</p><ul><li>Children under 2 months old with a rectal temperature above 100.4 degrees should be taken to the nearest Children&rsquo;s Emergency Center immediately.</li><li>Parents of otherwise healthy children older than 2 months old should call their child&rsquo;s pediatrician&rsquo;s office before heading to the ER.</li><li>High-risk populations, such as children with cancer or sickle cell disease, should come to the ER whenever a fever is above 101 degrees.</li><li>Unimmunized children under 2-3 years old should be seen by their pediatrician any time they have a fever. Immunizations reduce a child&rsquo;s risk of getting serious, preventable diseases, but if a child hasn&rsquo;t been immunized, he or she could be at risk.</li><li>A fever that lasts more than two or three days should be assessed by a pediatrician or, if directed by the pediatrician, the closest Children&rsquo;s Emergency Center.</li><li>If your child has a febrile seizure, please call 911 and get evaluated in the ER.</li></ul><p>For most children, Dr. Gilligan said the child&rsquo;s response to fever-reducing medication is more telling than the fever itself.</p><p>&ldquo;For example, if a child has a 104.5-degree fever, receives ibuprofen, and 40 minutes later is active and looking better, I am not too worried,&rdquo; Dr. Gilligan said. &ldquo;If the child has a 100.5-degree fever and still looks and acts sick after receiving ibuprofen, I am more concerned with this child. But parents should trust their gut and bring their child to the ER if they feel it&rsquo;s a true emergency.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Tips to lower temperatures</strong></p><p>Dr. Gilligan recommends parents try lowering their child&rsquo;s fever by giving him or her the appropriate dose of fever-reducing medication, like ibuprofen (Advil&reg;) or acetaminophen (Tylenol&reg;). Your child&#39;s pediatrician can recommend the proper dose based on age and weight. Parents can also try dressing their child in loose clothing or giving him or her a lukewarm bath.</p><p>&ldquo;If your child&rsquo;s not responding to fever medication, or if the fever is persisting for two or three days, call your child&rsquo;s pediatrician or take him or her to the nearest Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Emergency Center for evaluation,&rdquo; said Dr. Gilligan.</p><p><em>When your child needs the expert care of pediatric emergency medicine physicians, Wolfson Children&rsquo;s has six Emergency Centers throughout Northeast Florida.

Borges-Figueroa continued chest compressions while Markert was rushed into an exam room.</p><p>&ldquo;The nurse actually had to get on top of my husband on the stretcher to continue CPR while he was being wheeled into the exam room,&rdquo; remembered Mrs. Markert.</p><p>The medical team worked to stabilize Markert, who was experiencing &ldquo;ventricular fibrillation,&rdquo; a condition in which the chambers of the heart quiver rather than pump blood. &ldquo;Jim was essentially dead,&rdquo; said Dr. King. &ldquo;We had to shock his heart several times to restore a normal rhythm.&rdquo;</p><p>Once Markert was stable enough to be transported, he was rushed by ambulance to the heart catheterization lab at Baptist Heart Hospital.

This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.</p><p>Former NFL linebacker Neiron Ball, who was diagnosed with an AVM while in college, died from complications of a ruptured aneurysm in 2019. He was 27. Country star Drake White was diagnosed with an AVM in January 2019 when he was 35.</p><p><strong>Three approaches</strong></p><p>Gan first noticed something was wrong when he started having headaches twice a day while at work.</p><p>&ldquo;On a scale of one to 10, my pain was about an eight,&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;Then it started to affect my left eye. At first, I thought it was because I have high blood pressure and allergies.&rdquo;</p><p>After seeing his otolaryngologist, Justin Moy, MD, of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-ent-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist ENT Specialists</a>, Gan had a CT scan of his sinuses. The result: his sinuses were fine but something was amiss with his left frontal lobe. Further imaging tests detected the presence of a grade-2 or medium-size AVM measuring between 3 and 6 centimeters.</p><p>&ldquo;My wife and I sat down and came up with a plan of attack,&rdquo; Gan said. &ldquo;A friend of hers recommended neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-ricardo-hanel-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ricardo Hanel</a>, MD, PhD, co-director of the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-center\" target=\"_blank\">Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center&nbsp;</a>at Baptist Jacksonville.

Then the neurosurgeon utilizes surgical tools to seal off and remove the AVM.</p><p>During minimally invasive endovascular embolization, the neurosurgeon threads a small, flexible tube or catheter through an artery in the groin until the tiny catheter reaches an artery that feeds the AVM with blood. The surgeon then injects either glue-like substances or tiny metal coils to block the artery and reduce or block bloodflow to the AVM.</p><p>Finally, in radiosurgery, the surgeon uses a high dose of targeted radiation beams to damage and eventually close the blood vessels that make up the AVM.</p><p>&ldquo;I told Dr. Hanel to give me the good old-fashioned approach,&rdquo; said Gan. &ldquo;We set a date for the craniotomy but first he had to plug up the blood supply to the AVM to minimize the risk of bleeding. That&rsquo;s when Dr. Hanel and my groin became acquainted.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>No sugarcoating it</strong></p><p>Gan underwent three neurosurgical procedures, including two embolizations, at Baptist Jacksonville before his craniotomy on May 18, 2018. One of the toughest parts of his entire AVM journey was reassuring his family members that everything was going to turn out OK.</p><p>&ldquo;When you mention the words &lsquo;brain surgery,&rsquo; everyone kind of pauses,&rdquo; Gan said. &ldquo;My wife and I didn&rsquo;t sugarcoat anything. We said it was a complex and delicate procedure. Being in the medical profession, we were just very focused on the treatment. We knew we were in good hands with Dr. Hanel.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite significant advancements in the diagnoses and treatment of brain AVMs, what causes them is still a mystery. Most researchers believe AVMs occur during fetal development, meaning people who have this condition were likely born with it.</p><p>Added Dr. Hanel: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re definitely a lot less common than aneurysms. An AVM creates a high-pressure system in the brain, making it more prone to bleeding. So, in Gab&rsquo;s case, we went through the groin first to shut down some of those tangled blood vessels and then opened the head and took them out.&rdquo;</p><p>Gan said he felt fine after waking up from surgery. The following day, family members flocked to his bedside, filling every inch of his recovery room. &ldquo;Me being Filipino, there was food galore,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But I had to pass a swallow test in order to eat. I told everyone in the room to be quiet while I did the test because there was no way I was failing that.&rdquo;</p><p>After passing a walking/stairs test on the third day, Gan was discharged home. Two months later, &ldquo;after burning a hole in his couch,&rdquo; he went back to nursing on a limited basis and is now working full-time again and studying for a master&rsquo;s degree in nursing.</p><p>Gan takes pride in the fact that his halo-like surgical scar is another way he can connect with his patients.</p><p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t believe I went through four brain surgeries in a two-month span and came back to work like nothing happened,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope it gives them reassurance that they can come back from their surgeries, too.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with a brain AVM, you&rsquo;ll find the care and support you need at&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/lyerly-neurosurgery\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Lyerly Neurosurgery.</em></a></p>",

Her treatment, which included surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, left her nauseous, tired and run-down.</p><p>Even as she battled these side effects, she didn&rsquo;t want to miss the opportunity to participate in the DONNA festivities. It was her chance to feel surrounded and supported by a community of fighters and survivors, many of whom were battling or had battled breast cancer. She signed up for the half marathon in 2008, and she has been there every year since.</p><p>&ldquo;I had no idea how strong I could be until I had to be,&rdquo; Morton said.</p><p>Now, Morton is paying it forward.

Morton hopes to eventually work with pediatric oncology patients again and is eager to apply the lessons she is learning as an adult oncology nurse.</p><p>For now, though, she is excited about the latest DONNA weekend.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a challenging race that symbolizes her own cancer journey, and it&rsquo;s a reminder that, whether she&rsquo;s battling cancer or advocating for her patients, she was, and always will be, a fighter.</p><p><em>If you or a loved one needs a cancer specialist, please call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"tel:1-904-202-7300\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.202.7300</em></a><em>&nbsp;or visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\"><em>BaptistMDAnderson.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

Just like blockages in the heart&rsquo;s vessels, PAD is caused by a buildup of plaque and fatty material on the inner walls of the arteries in the extremities.</p><p>Not only does it make it difficult to walk, but PAD is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke. It&rsquo;s more common in African-Americans than other groups, and men are slightly more likely than women to develop PAD. Peripheral artery disease is also more common in smokers.</p><p>PAD symptoms may include leg pain or numbness, coldness in your lower leg or foot, and painful leg cramps.</p><p>For most patients with PAD, a minimally invasive procedure through the femoral artery (located in the groin) is the usual approach. However, for some patients who have already had stents in this area or whose body type is not ideal for the traditional approach, a new option may be beneficial.</p><p>This was the case with Harry Morris, whose PAD got so severe, he could no longer walk and sleeping was difficult since he had little circulation when lying down. His hobbies of fishing and restoring old cars were on hold, not to mention his overall quality of life suffering greatly.</p><p>Fortunately, his cardiologist, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-bharat-gummadi-md\">Bharat Gummadi, MD,&nbsp;</a>at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-south\">Baptist Medical Center South,</a> was determined to find a solution. After attempting to clear the veins through the usual femoral approach without success, he looked into other options.</p><p>Dr. Gummadi had previous success in helping heart patients with blockages by going through a radial approach, which involves inserting a catheter into an artery in the wrist and guiding it to the blocked artery in the heart to clear the plaque.</p><p><strong>Overcoming a physical barrier</strong></p><p>The obstacle Dr. Gummadi faced was not having a catheter long enough to reach from the wrist down to Morris&rsquo;s lower left leg. But he was determined to find a way to make it happen, and was able to find a medical supply company that could provide the right-size catheter.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Gummadi was determined to find a solution,&rdquo; said Morris, who is not only walking pain-free now, but is back to his usual lifestyle. Morris was the first patient Dr. Gummadi performed the radial procedure on for PAD.</p><p>&ldquo;This approach through the wrist decreases complications and allows for quicker recovery,&rdquo; said Dr. Gummadi. &ldquo;With the radial approach, patients can sit up and get walking more quickly, which is vital to recovery.&rdquo; The procedure requires only local anesthesia.</p><p>After one night at Baptist South, Morris was able to go home. Many patients can go home the same day after radial intervention.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Gummadi got me straightened out,&rdquo; said Morris. &ldquo;I feel fortunate to be the first patient he performed this approach on.&rdquo; Since Morris&rsquo;s procedure, Dr. Gummadi plans to add the radial approach to his toolbox to help more patients recover from PAD.</p><p><em>If you&rsquo;re experiencing symptoms of PAD, appointments are available at&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/heart-vascular-care\"><em>Baptist Heart Specialists</em></a><em>&nbsp;by calling <a href=\"tel:1-904-720-0799\">904-720-0799</a></em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Have you ever wondered why children in the United States are required to get so many vaccines? It&rsquo;s for good reason.</p><p>By the time American children reach school age, they have likely received a handful of required shots, including ones for polio (IPV), chicken pox (varicella) and the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.</p><p>Do you really need them all? Are there any others parents should consider?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatric-infectious-disease-specialist/dr-mobeen-rathore-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mobeen Rathore</a>, MD, chief of Infectious Diseases and Immunology at <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>, said all vaccines are important and it would be &ldquo;dangerous to try and prioritize them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like asking me to pick who of my children I love more,&rdquo; said Dr. Rathore, a pediatrician and pediatric infectious disease specialist for more than 30 years, and a subject matter expert for local, regional and national media on pediatric topics.</p><p>Instead, Dr. Rathore recommends at least 12 vaccines parents should consider getting for their kids and some for themselves. &ldquo;Each of the vaccines has been carefully studied for safety and effectiveness and should be given as recommended by the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).&rdquo;</p><ol><li><strong>IPV&nbsp;</strong>- The CDC recommends U.S. children get four doses of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) before the age of 6, especially if traveling to other countries. Routine polio vaccination is not recommended for adults who were vaccinated as children.</li><li><strong>DTaP&nbsp;</strong>- This vaccine can help protect children under the age of 7 from diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. A booster shot known as Tdap is given to adolescents and adults.</li><li><strong>Hib</strong> - This vaccine protects against meningitis. A series of shots is usually given at 2 months of age and completed at 12-15 months of age. Children 12-15 months and 5 years of age who have not previously been completely vaccinated against Hib may need 1 or more doses, according to the CDC.</li><li>&nbsp;<strong>Pneumococcal</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>- The vaccine protects against pneumococcal infections like meningitis, bacteremia and pneumonia, and sinus inflammation. Anyone can get these infections but children under 2, people with certain medical conditions, adults 65 or older, and cigarette smokers are at the highest risk.</li><li><strong>Hepatitis B&nbsp;</strong>- Commonly transmitted from mother to child during birth and delivery, this viral infection attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic diseases, including liver cancer. This vaccine protects against this serious health condition.</li><li><strong>Rotavirus&nbsp;</strong>- This is a contagious virus that can lead to severe diarrhea in infants and young children. It can also lead to dehydration</li><li><strong>MMR</strong> - The vaccine protects people against measles, mumps and rubella, and prevents the complications caused by these diseases.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Varicella (chickenpox)</strong> -<strong>&nbsp;</strong>All healthy children ages 12 months to age 18 should have two doses of the chickenpox vaccination. This protection is especially important for people who cannot get vaccinated, such as children under 12 months of age, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems.</li><li><strong>Meningococcal&nbsp;</strong>- This vaccine protects against five types of meningococcus and is recommended for ages 11-18.</li><li><strong>HPV</strong> - According to the CDC, about 14 million Americans become infected each year with the human papillomavirus virus (HPV), typically passed through genital contact. The HPV vaccine also protects against cervical cancer.</li><li><strong>Hepatitis A&nbsp;</strong>-This virus can cause acute liver disease. Symptoms can last from a few weeks to several months. It is commonly spread from person to person and outbreaks spread through person-to-person contact.</li><li><strong>Influenza&nbsp;</strong>- This every-year shot protects against three viruses and reduces the risk of flu illness and hospitalization among children and adults. The shot is especially important for people who are at high risk for influenza complications. Immunizing everyone (including pregnant women) over the age of 6 months protects those who cannot receive the vaccine because of age or medical conditions.</li></ol><p><em>To find out which vaccines may be right for you or your family, talk to your primary care doctor or your child&rsquo;s&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/primary-care\" target=\"_blank\"><em>pediatrician</em></a>. <em>If you or your child needs a primary care provider, call <a href=\"tel:1-904-202-4968\" target=\"_blank\">904.202.4968</a>(4968).&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Source:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>CDC Vaccines &amp; Immunizations</em></a></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Most of us take simple things like lying down or going out to dinner for granted. For Hope Tallon, these basic activities left a bad taste in her mouth &ndash; literally.</p><p>&ldquo;I had severe heartburn and reflux for 25 years, and it got progressively worse during the past 10 years,&rdquo; Tallon said. &ldquo;I had symptoms every single day. It caused burning pain and a horrible bitter taste. Playing with my dogs on the floor or even doing a yoga plank would trigger it. Even taking a sip of water could cause the stomach acid to come up.&rdquo;</p><p>Tallon had a condition called GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), which affects about 25% of the population. Some people&rsquo;s symptoms can be assuaged by diet changes and medications, but for Tallon, nothing relieved her chronic reflux.</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t drink coffee, alcohol, spicy or fried foods, beef, cheese, and the list went on,&rdquo; she said. Antacids and PPIs (proton pump inhibiting medication) didn&rsquo;t provide relief. Even buying a special bed to sleep upright didn&rsquo;t help.</p><p>An endoscopy revealed that Tallon had early onset of Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus, a condition in which erosion of the esophagus could eventually lead to cancer.</p><p>&ldquo;My throat was so raw that I couldn&rsquo;t even eat a potato chip,&rdquo; Tallon said. Her physician recommended she see <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/general-surgeon/dr-craig-morgenthal-md\">Craig Morgenthal, MD,</a> a surgeon at Baptist Center for Bariatric and <a href=\"http://refluxjax.com\">Reflux Surgery.</a></p><p>&ldquo;Hope was a perfect candidate for a procedure called the <a href=\"http://refluxjax.com\">LINX Reflux Management System.&nbsp;</a>She was young and healthy and had exhausted a number of solutions,&rdquo; Dr. Morgenthal said.</p><p>Even for patients who do see improvement with medication, long-term PPI use may be associated with potentially dangerous side effects, including increased risk of bone fractures and a potential link to increased risk of dementia, according to JAMA Neurology.</p><p><strong>What is LINX and how does it help?</strong></p><p>LINX is small ring about the size of a quarter made of flexible bands of magnets enclosed in titanium beads. The device is placed around the lower esophageal sphincter just above the stomach. The beads open when food or liquid goes down the throat and then contract once food is swallowed so stomach acid can&rsquo;t back up.</p><p>&ldquo;The procedure is done in a minimally invasive way that usually takes an hour or so to perform,&rdquo; Dr. Morgenthal said. Patients, including Tallon, usually go home the next day.</p><p>&ldquo;I had two or three days where I had to take it easy, and then my world completely changed,&rdquo; said Tallon. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had any issues with heartburn or reflux since the surgery.&rdquo;</p><p>She is now off all of her medications and doesn&rsquo;t have any diet restrictions. She&rsquo;s decided to get back to gym to lift weights, something she couldn&rsquo;t do before the surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;People think they can just pop an antacid and live with it. They don&rsquo;t realize there are real solutions out there,&rdquo; said Tallon. &ldquo;I wish I would have done it sooner.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you have persistent reflux, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/general-surgeon/dr-craig-morgenthal-md\"><em>refluxjax.com</em></a><em>&nbsp;for more information or to make an appointment.&nbsp;</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>From hiccups to hangovers, we often turn to Dr. Google to answer our health questions. Now that we&rsquo;ve entered the 2020, we&rsquo;re taking a look back at 2019&rsquo;s most &ldquo;Googled&rdquo; health questions and giving you quick, reliable answers from our physicians. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. How to lower blood pressure?</strong></p><p>High blood pressure (hypertension) is a serious condition, known as the &ldquo;silent killer&rdquo; because often people have no symptoms. Hypertension affects one in three American adults. Controlling high blood pressure helps reduce the risk of heart disease. In some cases, diet and exercise can help lower blood pressure. Other times, you may need medications. Quick tips to prevent or lower high blood pressure include:</p><ul><li>Lose weight (if you need to)</li><li>Cut back on salt</li><li>Limit alcohol intake</li><li>Eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables</li></ul><p>&nbsp;Work with your doctor to find a plan that&rsquo;s right for you.</p><p><strong>2. What is keto?</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Keto is a short term to describe the ketogenic diet,&rdquo; explained Tristan Imhof, MD, family physician with Baptist Primary Care. &ldquo;Because carbohydrates are significantly restricted on this diet, the body enters into a metabolic state (ketosis) where the body relies on fats for energy rather than sugar.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>3. How to get rid of hiccups?</strong></p><p>Hiccups can be a total annoyance! There is no sure way to stop hiccups. However there are home remedies and suggestions you can try, including downing a teaspoon of sugar, drinking a glass of cold water or holding your breath. Contact your doctor if your hiccups last for more than a few days.</p><p><strong>4. How long does the flu last?</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Symptoms for the flu usually last between 3-7 days,&rdquo; said Dr. Imhof. &ldquo;Fever and the most severe symptoms may be resolved within a few days, but low energy and cough can last much longer.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>5. What causes hiccups?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Hiccups can often start for no apparent reason and without a cause. They&rsquo;re even normal in newborns and infants. However, some common links to hiccups include eating too quickly, eating hot and spicy foods, stress or swallowing air. More serious causes include stroke; a tumor affecting the brain; harmful fumes; or a disease that irritates the nerves that control the diaphragm.</p><p><strong>6. What causes kidney stones?</strong></p><p>There are different types of kidney stones and the cause depends on the type. Stones form when urine contains too much of a certain substance that forms crystals. Calcium stones are the most common and are most likely to occur in men between the ages of 20 and 30. The biggest risk factor for kidney stones is not drinking enough fluids. They are most likely to occur if you make less than one liter of urine a day.</p><p><strong>7. What is HPV?</strong></p><p>HPV is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause genital warts. In some people, HPV infection becomes persistent, and that can eventually leads to cervical cancer, or tumors of the vagina, penis, anus and throat.</p><p>&ldquo;HPV vaccine is designed primarily to protect women against cervical and vaginal cancers. In addition, it affords protection against penile cancers and laryngeal papillomas (a medical condition in which benign tumors grow along the aerodigestive tract),&rdquo; explained Mobeen Rathore, MD, pediatric infectious disease specialist at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. &ldquo;Therefore, the vaccine is most beneficial if given prior to the time a woman becomes sexually active. For the same reason, males also need to be protected from HPV with the use of the HPV vaccine.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>8. How to lower cholesterol?</strong></p><p>&ldquo;It&#39;s important to understand a little more about cholesterol in terms of its benefits and harms to the body,&rdquo; said Dr. Imhof. &ldquo;LDL cholesterol is the &lsquo;bad cholesterol&rsquo; we seek to lower in order to minimize cardiovascular events in the future. HDL cholesterol, on the other hand, is beneficial to the body and, when calculating your risk of heart disease, serves to reduce risk when it is elevated.&rdquo;</p><p>In most individuals, lowering LDL and increasing HDL can usually be managed through dietary modifications. However, other individuals have a genetic predisposition to elevated cholesterol and may require medications such as statins to lower their cholesterol levels, in addition to proper diet and exercise.</p><p>Limiting your intake of animal product, such as meat, dairy and eggs, has been found to be beneficial in lowering LDL and increasing HDL. Ongoing studies of newer diets and their long- term effects on cholesterol may provide more answers in the future.</p><p><strong>9. How many calories should I eat in a day?</strong></p><p>&ldquo;This depends on many variables, but for individuals with a normal body mass index (BMI), and who are participating in regular daily activity and eating a balanced diet, the standard daily caloric intake is set to 2,000 calories per day. This is what all food labels are calibrated to by percentage,&rdquo; said Dr. Imhof. &ldquo;When individuals deviate from the normal standards, the daily caloric recommendation may change drastically.</p><p>In a time where the majority of the population falls into an overweight or obese category, it&rsquo;s important to work with your doctor to discuss caloric modifications. For example, the daily caloric intake for these individuals should balance out to less than 2,000 calories per day, accounting for calories earned from increased exercise.</p><p>Dr. Imhof recommends calorie-counting apps for his patients who may need to lose weight. &ldquo;These allow individuals to input current data, goals and time period. From there, the app recommends how many calories per day they should consume.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>10. How long does alcohol stay in your system?</strong></p><p>If you drink alcohol, it&rsquo;s best to do so in moderation. The recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a maximum of one drink for women per day and two drinks for men per day.</p><p>According to the CDC, the liver can only metabolize a small amount of alcohol at a time. Excess alcohol circulates throughout the body and blood stream. On average it takes one hour to metabolize one standard drink.</p><p>Search engine results can deliver thousands of pages of information. How do you know what&rsquo;s correct? We&rsquo;d recommend turning to your primary care physician. He or she knows YOU and your health history and can provide you with the most accurate advice.</p><p><em>Need a primary care physician who&rsquo;s right for you? &nbsp;Call <a href=\"tel:1-904-202-4968\" target=\"_blank\">904.202.4YOU</a>(4968) or visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.baptistjax.com/request\" target=\"_blank\"><em>baptistjax.com/request</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Dennis Herbert, 72, a three-time cancer survivor and lead guitarist in a classic rock band, is no stranger to challenges. But he was worried that radiation damage to his tissue from his cancer treatment would get the best of him.</p><p>Defeating prostate cancer required radiation treatments, and, as a result, Herbert developed a condition called radiation cystitis, which damages tissue in the bladder and causes scarring. The scars caused Herbert pelvic pain and bleeding, making it hard to walk and function normally. It got to the point where he needed a catheter bag.</p><p>Herbert thought this would be his &ldquo;new normal&rdquo; &ndash; a vast difference from the life he was accustomed to, spending time with his seven grandkids, designing custom jewelry and, of course, playing in his band.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the guy who hurts your ears,&rdquo; he said jokingly about being lead guitarist. Herbert continued to play at weddings and local venues even though he could barely walk.</p><p>&ldquo;They propped me up on a stool, but it was getting really difficult,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>He and his wife, Peggy, were relieved when they learned that <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-south\">Baptist Medical Center South</a> had recently opened a Center for Wound Care and Hyperbaric Medicine, hoping it might be the answer he needed to resume normal life.</p><p>Herbert was evaluated by <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/hyperbaric-medicine-specialist/dr-anamika-agrawal-do\">Anamika Agrawal, DO,</a> a wound care and hyperbaric medicine specialist, who determined that hyperbaric oxygen therapy would be a good option for healing his internal wounds.</p><p><strong>How can oxygen heal?</strong></p><p>Hyperbaric medicine works by delivering high levels of oxygen to the patient&rsquo;s bloodstream in a pressurized environment. This increases the supply of oxygen delivered to the wounded tissue, stimulating new growth in blood vessels. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been shown to enhance the healing process.<br><br>The treatment takes place in a chamber you can see out of, and the patient lies on a stretcher inside the pressurized chamber. Patients breathe 100% oxygen and their blood carries the extra oxygen to the injured area.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;When you breathe 100% oxygen, it reaches your blood vessels and helps renew dead tissue,&rdquo; explained Dr. Agrawal. &ldquo;When a person has radiation treatment [for cancer], it kills the bad cells but unfortunately, it kills good tissue as well. That&rsquo;s what happened in Dennis&rsquo;s case.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/wound-care\">Hyperbaric medicine</a> is increasingly being used for cancer patients who&rsquo;ve had the same experience.</p><p>Herbert had a total of 50 treatments (90 minutes each) which he went to every day for three months except on weekends. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel any pain. The only thing I noticed was my ears popping and a little pressure,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Being in a small space was not a problem for Herbert, who spent many years piloting his own single-engine plane. &ldquo;The chamber is about the same size as a small cockpit,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>To help pass the time, patients can watch movies or TV. &ldquo;I watched all nine Star Wars movies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The experience was so much better than I ever expected.&rdquo;</p><p>After about 15 treatments, Herbert started to notice a difference. Half-way through his treatments, he felt well enough to walk on a treadmill.</p><p>Now that his treatments are over, Herbert&rsquo;s wounds are healed and he&rsquo;s been able to resume his normal activities and add a few new ones, like working out at the gym and doing yoga.</p><p>&ldquo;Before this treatment, my walk was a shuffle. Now I can dance,&rdquo; said Herbert. And, he&rsquo;s back on stage rockin&rsquo; out with his band.</p><p><em>If you&#39;re experiencing a wound that won&#39;t heal, call <a href=\"tel:1-904-202-4325\" target=\"_blank\">904.202.HEAL</a> for an appointment at one of our three&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/wound-care\"><em>Wound Care Centers.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>After fans expressed concern over Justin Bieber&rsquo;s ashen appearance, even speculating he was on drugs, the pop star posted that he was &ldquo;battling Lyme disease and winning.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread by infected ticks, most commonly the &ldquo;deer tick,&rdquo; found in wooded and grassy areas. It cannot be passed from person to person. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 30,000 Americans contract it each year.</p><p>&ldquo;Most cases are not serious, but can be if not diagnosed and treated early,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatric-infectious-disease-specialist/dr-mobeen-rathore-md\">Mobeen Rathore, MD,</a> an infectious disease specialist. The only way to confirm a true diagnosis is through blood work.</p><p>Early diagnosis is important because symptoms get worse the longer it goes untreated. Early symptoms include headaches and neck stiffness. The most obvious sign is a red bulls-eye shaped rash, which doesn&rsquo;t always appear. Later symptoms may include hearing loss, paralysis of the face, heart complications, nausea and arthritis. Not getting treatment in the first six weeks may lead to lifelong complications.</p><p>Bieber&rsquo;s Lyme disease went undiagnosed for much of last year, according to news reports. &ldquo;One of the problems in diagnosing the disease is that many of the symptoms are non-specific, and can easily be attributed to other conditions,&rdquo; Dr. Rathore said.</p><p>Lyme disease is found mostly in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central United States.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely rare in Florida. If someone has Lyme disease in our state, it is likely they contracted it elsewhere,&rdquo; said Dr. Rathore.</p><p>Although you&rsquo;re unlikely to get Lyme disease in Florida, it&rsquo;s still a good idea to protect yourself.</p><div class=\"u-size4of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1579730977/Juice/Prevent_Tick_Bites_Infographic.jpg\" alt=\"Prevent_Tick_Bites\"></div><p>Tips to avoid contracting Lyme disease</p><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t veer off the trail.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>As the school year wears on and assignments build up, extracurriculars are in full swing, and standardized testing looms, parents of students may notice their children coming home more and more frazzled. But some students are dealing with issues at home, too. And new research shows it can really affect their academics.</p><p>A recent study on adverse childhood events (ACEs), published in the journal <em>Pediatrics</em>, found that children who experience difficult life events tend to perform worse academically. Children exposed to four or more ACEs were more than twice as likely to repeat one or more grades at school and four times more likely to regularly skip homework than kids with no ACEs. However, researchers found that a decrease in performance didn&rsquo;t happen if a parent or loved one spent time building a relationship with the child.</p><p>ACEs include experiences like parents divorcing, witnessing or being the victim of abuse, seeing mental illness or addiction in the home, and more. <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-devon-patterson-phd\" target=\"_blank\">De&#39;Von Patterson, PhD</a>, a psychologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>, said it&rsquo;s important to know the effects ACEs can have and how to minimize them for children.</p><p>&ldquo;For example, in some environments, parents may have an exposure to someone completing suicide or the homicide of a family member. If the kid didn&#39;t witness the incident directly, there are things you can do to lessen the impact of it. Part of that will be sparing them the specific details of things and giving them developmentally appropriate communication about that. Sometimes you can&rsquo;t help it because the child was around it, whether it&rsquo;s physical abuse or witnessing something, but in events when they don&rsquo;t know about it, you can shield them in that way by not giving them imagery.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>ACEs and mental health</strong></p><p>A child&rsquo;s mental well-being is a priority after an ACE occurs, and taking care of their mind and emotions can help them manage their usual routine, including schoolwork and extracurriculars.</p><p>&ldquo;If you see any behavioral changes, it&rsquo;s worth taking them to a mental health clinician to evaluate how they&rsquo;re doing. The clinician can give them information on their level of functioning and determine whether they would benefit from treatment,&rdquo; said Dr. Patterson. &ldquo;Even if I have someone who will not be continuing treatment, I can explain to parents, &lsquo;If you see this or that happen, come back because I want to know about it.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s no reason to be overly hesitant about seeking out mental health services. It&rsquo;s OK to go before you&rsquo;re absolutely sure your child needs them.&rdquo;</p><p>The best way to ensure your child, or a child in your family, can handle the ACEs in their life is to strengthen your relationship as much as possible. Positive relationships are considered a protective factor, or something that can offset the potential damage of ACEs. Other protective factors the study identified include:</p><ul><li>Living in a safe neighborhood</li><li>Having family dinners</li><li>Regular conversations between parents and kids</li><li>A smoke-free household</li></ul><p>&ldquo;How parents develop a connection with their kids is going to be really important,&quot; said Dr. Patterson. &quot;An issue I see often is parents being very reactive to things their kids tell them. If a kiddo wants to share something with a parent and the adult has a big reaction, a negative reaction or yells at them, that teaches the child how the parent will respond to other things in the future, right or wrong. If they always give them a big reaction, they&rsquo;ll be reluctant to share things.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;I work with parents a lot on being able to hear their child and talk about their expectations for them without the big reactivity,&quot; he added. &quot;Part of that is going to be parents managing their own emotions. If the kiddo feels they can bring things to you, that can serve as an important source.&quot;</p><p><strong>Engaging with your child&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Dr. Patterson said parents should always try to connect with their children emotionally, even about things that may seem like no big deal to an adult.</p><p>&ldquo;Taking the time to engage with your child on something he or she is excited about is a gesture that signals, &lsquo;Hey, this person cares about what I care about, and they&rsquo;ll listen if I bring something to them.&rsquo; When you&rsquo;re having those conversations with teens and preteens, don&rsquo;t be dismissive of the things they&rsquo;re talking about. This is a common thing I see with parents where, if they&rsquo;re upset about a friend who did something to them or a boyfriend who broke up with them, the parent dismisses it with, &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t even know this person in 10 years and it won&rsquo;t matter.&rsquo; It makes them feel like you don&rsquo;t understand them or what they&rsquo;re trying to share with you. If you&rsquo;ve been dismissive in the past, it&rsquo;s a fair assumption for them to think you&rsquo;ll do that going forward.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Patterson said you don&rsquo;t have to be a child&rsquo;s parent, or know anything about their life events, to be a protective factor for them. In fact, many children find these relationships in extended family and teachers, too.</p><p>&ldquo;Give children an outlet to talk with you about things. If you can become someone they believe they can share things with, being able to connect with you is going to be helpful,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it repeatedly where a kiddo is in a horrible situation but they have an adult at home, in the family or in school they believe cares about them, and it&rsquo;s an incredible resource for them to reduce symptoms and make them feel connected. Parents, encourage the development of those relationships. Encourage extracurriculars where they can find that in their peers and other adult figures, like coaches.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If your child is struggling with school or experiencing an adverse childhood event, call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"tel:1-904-376-3800\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.376.3800</em></a><em>&nbsp;to connect with a pediatric behavioral health provider who can help.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>If a picture is posted on Instagram and no one is around to &quot;like&quot; it, did it really post? Instagram is testing that theory in the U.S. as likes start disappearing from certain users&rsquo; accounts. Those users will no longer see how many times a photo or video has been liked, just the post itself and any comments. Only on the user&rsquo;s own photos will like counts still appear.</p><p>Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, says this is meant to make Instagram a safer space, specifically for kids and teens.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s about young people,&quot; Mosseri said during an industry symposium announcing the change. &quot;The idea is to try to &#39;depressurize&#39; Instagram, make it less of a competition and give people more space to focus on connecting with people that they love and things that inspire them.&quot;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-devon-patterson-phd\" target=\"_blank\">De&#39;Von Patterson, PhD</a>, a psychologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>, said that there is some research about how teens&rsquo; brains react to likes and comments, but ultimately, Instagram&rsquo;s like changes may not be the answer to making the IG a safe space.</p><p>&ldquo;I have adolescents as young as 10 or 11 who are dealing with cyberbullying. Little to none of it is related to likes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Likes are certainly a source of validation, and people get positive feelings when they have more of them, but the distress usually comes from being excluded from a group or seeing a friend with another friend. There&rsquo;s an indirect kind of cyberbullying where someone says they don&rsquo;t like this person and others can comment, so you see everyone piling on, and it&rsquo;s difficult to deal with because kiddos are not going to make a distinction between how people&rsquo;s behavior changes between online and real life, so they feel it just as much as they feel things that happen in school.&rdquo;</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says cyberbullying &mdash; any bullying behavior that takes place online &mdash; includes sending mean messages to someone, sharing embarrassing pictures of them, creating or spreading untrue stories about them, and more. Dr. Patterson assures parents they can help their child avoid it with a little bit of supervision: in person and online.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How can parents help?</strong></p><p>First, it&rsquo;s important to watch for signs of cyberbullying.</p><p>&ldquo;Red flags would include any kind of behavioral changes or changes in demeanor, energy level, eating habits or sleeping habits,&quot; said Dr. Patterson. &quot;If a parent notices any changes, it&rsquo;s worth bringing them to a clinician. All the time, I have parents who see some changes in their child or have some concerns, and they bring them in even though they don&rsquo;t have any &lsquo;major&rsquo; red flags. I&rsquo;m always happy to see that because there have been times that a child was severely depressed but wasn&rsquo;t showing any other signs a parent would look for.&rdquo;</p><p>Since the signs aren&rsquo;t always obvious, or your child may not disclose exactly what&rsquo;s causing these changes, it&rsquo;s key for parents to supervise their child&rsquo;s social media use.</p><p>&ldquo;The biggest thing is putting some limits in place. One thing I see is parents will give kids free rein on the weekends, so they&rsquo;ll wake up and be on electronics and social media 12 or 14 hours,&rdquo; said Dr. Patterson. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re limiting it and then giving them free rein, I&rsquo;m not sure how much you&rsquo;re really accomplishing, so that screen time limit should take some form on the weekends as well. On the weekend, there are always developments on social media and kids may feel compelled to keep up with them. There needs to be a point where they&rsquo;re stepping away from it.&rdquo;</p><p>Lastly, Dr. Patterson recommends that parents are mindful of what their kids are watching and liking online. Make sure it doesn&rsquo;t warp their perception of real versus highlight reel.</p><p>&ldquo;In general, social media affects kids&rsquo; perception of what is normal, both in terms of what someone&rsquo;s life looks like, as well as body image. People are posting the best things happening, the best photos.That&rsquo;s problematic for kids because this is that time they&rsquo;re developing an understanding of how things work. If they&rsquo;re heavily using social media, that&rsquo;s affecting their perception of what life and relationships should look like. Parents should be aware of what their kids are watching and talk with them about that, helping them process it.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If your child is experiencing negative emotions from their social media use or is being cyberbullied, call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"tel:1-904-376-3800\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.376.3800</em></a><em>&nbsp;to connect with a pediatric behavioral health provider who can help.

Dieting is successful for only 5% of morbidly obese people and medical treatments can be expensive and sometimes have negative side effects.</p><p><strong>You have a weight-related serious health issue, such as type II diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, high cholesterol or sleep apnea.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You are committed to a long-term lifestyle change</strong>. Bariatric surgery is only a tool for weight loss; a strict diet and exercise regimen must be followed for optimal weight loss.</p><p><a href=\"\">The Baptist Center for Bariatric Surgery</a> performs the three most common types of bariatric surgery, which include gastric banding, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Most of the time, bariatric surgery is done in a minimally invasive way, which has shorter recovery times than open procedures. You can expect to spend a day or two in the hospital and it may be one to three weeks before you can return to work.</p><p><em>If you&rsquo;re interested in attending a free seminar about Bariatric Surgery, you can register at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/bariatric-surgery\">baptistbariatrics.com</a>.

The goal is to lose traction in your rear tires, and, if you&rsquo;re lucky, tap the bumper of the car in front of you without spinning out of control.</p><div style=\"position: relative; display: block; max-width: 100%;\"><div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/4709052668001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6120483574001\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div></div><p>Harris was up for the challenge. After her diagnosis with a grade 4 glioblastoma in 2016, drifting seemed like a piece of cake. It&rsquo;s no wonder Dr. Cavaliere&rsquo;s team referred to her as one of their happiest cancer patients.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re happy and you&rsquo;ve got positive thoughts, your body feels better,&rdquo; Harris said.</p><p><strong>Unexpected news</strong></p><p>Harris has maintained a positive attitude throughout her treatment, but the brain tumor was the last thing she expected during that Thanksgiving. After a half-day at work as a phlebotomist with Baptist Primary Care the day before Thanksgiving, she went home to rest. Her nose was stuffed up and she had a sore throat and a headache. She thought it was her annual upper respiratory infection coming back.</p><p>But the headache got worse on Thanksgiving. Harris spent the whole day in bed, wearing a scarf around her head and sunglasses inside because light and sound made her head hurt even more. When she woke up, she thought it was Thursday night, but it was Friday night. She had slept for more than 24 hours. Any time she got up, she felt nauseous and sometimes vomited.</p><p>Her family and boyfriend were worried. Harris was not one to lie in bed all day. They took her to the ER when her headache continued and her vomiting didn&rsquo;t stop, and she got a CT scan and an MRI.</p><p>That&rsquo;s when the Baptist Health team found the brain tumor, which had weakened her optical nerve on the right side, leading to the painful headache. They also found a cancerous growth on her thyroid that was too small to require surgery but which they continue to monitor.</p><p>The following Monday, she went into surgery with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-ricardo-hanel-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ricardo Hanel, MD</a>, neurosurgeon at Baptist Health, to have the brain tumor removed. Dr. Hanel was able to remove 95% of it, taking out as much as he could because attempting to remove the remaining 5% would have risked injuring Harris.</p><p>After the surgery, Harris took three months off from work to heal, eventually going in for half days until she got stir-crazy. Dr. Cavaliere ordered a chemotherapy and radiation regimen, with the goal of controlling the tumor&rsquo;s growth. The treatment lasted for about a year-and-a-half.</p><p>Throughout this time, Harris&rsquo;s family and boyfriend were there to support her.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1577893784/Juice/Christie_Harris_Rotated.png\" alt=\"Christie-Harris\"></div><p><strong>Driving forward</strong></p><p>As she recovered from treatment, Harris didn&rsquo;t let her brain tumor stop her from pursuing her fun weekend plans. Life since her diagnosis has been similar to the extreme sports she loves &mdash; active, busy and fast-paced, with a focus on the future. She doesn&rsquo;t dwell on her cancer, and she doesn&rsquo;t want people to feel bad for her.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m strong enough on my own,&rdquo; Harris said. &ldquo;Cancer can&rsquo;t kill me.

Each back-and-forth motion is more than a thrill; it shows how much progress Noah, who has autism spectrum disorder (ASD), has made since he started regular appointments with <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/rehabilitation\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Rehabilitation</a>. Just a few months ago, Noah hated the swing, which is regularly incorporated into his sessions to stimulate different senses.</p><p><strong>Without words</strong></p><p>The Sullivans first brought Noah to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Rehabilitation at Baptist Medical Center Beaches because he hadn&rsquo;t developed verbal communication skills.</p><p>&ldquo;He would reach physical milestones, but the words just weren&rsquo;t coming,&rdquo; Marissa Sullivan said.</p><p>Noah&rsquo;s care team at the clinic recommended he start the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/rehabilitation/early-autism-intervention-program\" target=\"_blank\">Early Autism Intervention Program&nbsp;</a>at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Autism and Neurodevelopment Center, which he began in September 2019. The program focuses on children under 5 years old who have been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder or who have signs and symptoms of autism. The multidisciplinary care team is comprised of occupational and speech-language pathologists, and applied behavior analysts to address all aspects of each child&rsquo;s condition.</p><p>Lauren Papke, CCC-SLP, Noah&rsquo;s speech-language pathologist and the Early Autism Intervention Program lead, explained why early intervention in ASD is so important. &ldquo;The brain is considered to be most plastic up until the age of 4, so you can make the most change in those early years,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When Noah first came in, he was having a hard time participating in play-based activities. Typically, a child would be able to come in and play with a variety of toys and pay attention to his or her parents and the therapists, whereas Noah would kind of pace around the room and he had very little focus on toys or people.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size4of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1578416074/Juice/2.jpg\" alt=\"Noah Appointment\"></div><p><strong>The surprise appointment</strong></p><p>Since Noah is nonverbal, he communicates primarily by leading people to what he wants them to see or do. He also is what Papke calls &ldquo;routine-based,&rdquo; meaning if things don&rsquo;t happen in the order he expects, it can trigger a meltdown. That&rsquo;s why one Monday morning, when Noah and his parents arrived at the wrong time for an appointment, Papke made an effort to see them anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s mom was very apologetic,&rdquo; Papke said. &ldquo;She said &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but we&rsquo;re not getting any sleep because he keeps wetting the bed at night.&rsquo; So I asked whether that was a new concern, and Marissa said although he still wet the bed occasionally, he had soaked through his sheets three times the previous night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We just really believed it was a symptom of him getting older in combination with us not being able to fully tackle potty training,&rdquo; Mrs. Sullivan said. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t think there was much else to it.&rdquo;</p><p>But Papke thought something else might be wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;When children are nonverbal, they can&rsquo;t tell us when something is going on with them,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;As providers for this population, we&rsquo;re used to having to think deeply about how a child&rsquo;s nonverbal behaviors might be trying to tell us something. We know that being thirsty and frequent bedwetting could be symptoms of type 1 diabetes.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Another diagnosis</strong></p><p>Papke recommended the Sullivans take Noah to the pediatrician for a blood sugar test. After the test, the pediatrician urged them to go home, pack a bag and head straight to the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/emergency\" target=\"_blank\">Emergency Center downtown</a>. There, Noah was officially diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you the anxiety Mike and I felt as we were walking into the ER,&rdquo; Mrs. Sullivan said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m telling you, every single person &ndash; from the wonderful woman who checked us in to every nurse or doctor that I stopped to make sure they knew Noah was autistic &ndash; seemed as though they had been hand-picked to work at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s because they were so wonderful. And this all started because Lauren cared enough to try to find an answer.&rdquo;</p><p>Noah was admitted to the hospital for three days so pediatric endocrinologists and hospitalists could monitor his blood sugars and his parents could go through diabetes education to prepare them to care for their son.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone was fantastic,&rdquo; Mrs. Sullivan said. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have to be. No one was watching them, but they were absolutely fantastic.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Appreciation beyond words</strong></p><p>The Sullivans are adjusting to their new normal, continuing to bring Noah to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Autism and Neurodevelopment Center twice a week while also treating his diabetes at home. For Papke, the critical thinking that compelled her to urge the Sullivans to get Noah tested is part of the job.</p><p>&ldquo;When we hear something that sounds out of the ordinary, we want to make sure we&rsquo;re covering all the bases and checking everything,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>But for Mike and Marissa Sullivan, Papke&rsquo;s simple act left them speechless.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of those unbelievable experiences where if things hadn&rsquo;t fallen into place the way they did, who knows what could have happened,&rdquo; Marissa said.</p><div class=\"u-size4of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1578416073/Juice/4.jpg\" alt=\"Noah Appointment 2\"></div><p><em>The&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/rehabilitation/early-autism-intervention-program\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Early Autism Intervention Program</em></a><em>&nbsp;at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Autism and Neurodevelopment Center treats children ages 18 months to 4 years who have or are at risk for a neurodevelopmental disorder such as autism spectrum disorder, a social communication disorder or other developmental delays.

Whether it&rsquo;s a smaller waist, thinner arms or more defined curves, the power to create the &quot;perfect body&quot; is in the palm of your hands.</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s the problem?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/licensed-mental-health-counselor/mary-lou-prendergast-lmhc\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Lou Prendergast, LMHC</a>, a licensed mental health counselor with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>, warns body-altering apps can lead to body dysmorphic disorder &ndash; a condition in which people fixate on real or perceived flaws &ndash; which then can lead to eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very damaging,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a recipe for disaster in some cases.&rdquo;</p><p>Prendergast, who specializes in conditions such as body dysmorphic disorder, eating disorders and self-esteem issues, believes apps that allow users to alter their bodies or faces in photos are targeted toward teens and young adults. These two age groups often feel pressure to project a certain image on social media.</p><p>&ldquo;The problem with social media is we think we&rsquo;re putting things out there to share our lives with other people, but as a recipient of social media, we&rsquo;re actually comparing ourselves to others,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I see girls I work with in real life during counseling and they&rsquo;ll show me what they post on social media. They&rsquo;re able to make their waists look smaller, anything really. And the end result is, they&rsquo;re not even the same person that they are in real life.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Instagram vs. reality</strong></p><p>The issue arises, Prendergast said, when teens and young adults don&rsquo;t feel comfortable interacting with others in real life because their actual appearance doesn&rsquo;t match the image they&rsquo;ve portrayed to others on social media.</p><p>&ldquo;Social media just distorts their senses of reality, both with their own body and what they see from everyone else online,&rdquo; Prendergast said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s this whole fake world going on.&rdquo;</p><p>Because teens are unlikely to give up social media entirely, Prendergast says it&rsquo;s important for parents to recognize signs that their child may have an unhealthy relationship with social media. They may include:</p><ul><li>Oversharing</li><li>Spending more time on social media than interacting with people in real life</li><li>Becoming stressed or upset if no one responds to a social media post</li><li>Spending at least four hours a day on social media, ignoring a real social life</li><li>Becoming obsessed with social media status</li><li>Waking up in the middle of the night to check social media profiles or posts</li><li>Feeling uncomfortable interacting with others outside social media</li><li>Being unable to curb social media usage, despite trying</li></ul><p><strong>Time to unplug</strong></p><p>If a teen is unable to put down his or her cell phone and engage in the real world for more than a few moments, Prendergast suggests parents intervene by creating some rules regarding social media usage. The agreement, crafted with input from both kids and parents, should address the following questions:</p><ol><li>What are the good things about social media use?</li><li>What are the potential problems with social media use?</li><li>What is the maximum daily time each person should spend on social media?</li><li>Which times should we unplug from social media?</li><li>Which areas of the home should we keep social media-free?</li><li>What are some alternative activities we can do instead of social media?</li></ol><p><em>Social media use and the pressure to be picture perfect can cause a variety of mental health issues in teens and young adults.

Christmas is coming, but I&rsquo;m not happy. I don&rsquo;t feel the way I&rsquo;m supposed to feel,&rdquo; the beloved cartoon character says in the animated TV special, &ldquo;A Charlie Brown Christmas.&rdquo;</p><p>Seasonal sadness is a common experience. Not everyone basks in uncomplicated joy this time of year.</p><p>Many of us have experienced at least one blue holiday in our lives due to a variety of factors, including the loss of a loved one or being separated from family members.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-lauren-frye-phd\" target=\"_blank\">Lauren Frye, PhD</a>, a licensed clinical psychologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>, has compiled a list of strategies to combat seasonal blues.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1576871624/Juice/lauren-frye-phd-8x10.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren-Frye\"></div><ol><li><strong>Practice self-compassion.</strong></li></ol><ul><li>For many people, providing nurture and care to others are actions that happen readily, and without much thought. However, during times when feeling &quot;down&quot; or &quot;blue,&quot; taking care of one&rsquo;s own needs may be bumped down to the end of the to-do list, or fall off the list altogether. Self-compassion and self-nurturement can include adhering to one&rsquo;s own nutritional needs, getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol and drugs of abuse, and increasing moments of peace through relaxation activities (i.e., yoga, mindfulness/meditation, slowed-breathing, etc.). Several research studies have found each of these self-compassion practices to be helpful in improving the blues.</li></ul><p><strong>Generate hopeful and encouraging thoughts.</strong></p><ul><li>For many experiencing the blues or seasonal sadness, negative thoughts about one&#39;s self and circumstance may flow readily. Helplessness and hopelessness may also follow thoughts about loss and loneliness. Solely focusing on the negative is known to deepen &quot;the blues.&quot; Instead of &quot;replaying&quot; discouraging thoughts, &quot;replace&quot; them with messages of encouragement and hope.</li></ul><p><strong>Adopt an attitude of gratitude.</strong></p><ul><li>When feeling down during the holidays, people who experience seasonal sadness may be frequently reminded of who or what they have lost. In addition to generating thoughts of hope and encouragement, it can be helpful to reflect on the things you have and the things going well each day (i.e., small daily accomplishments, positive feedback received from others, etc.).</li></ul><p><strong>Stay socially connected.</strong></p><ul><li>Withdrawal and isolation are known to worsen the blues. Avoiding other people when you&#39;re feeling down actually deprives you of the opportunity to feel better from social support. Initiating greetings and pleasant conversations with others creates opportunities for uplifting interactions. Enjoy an activity together with a family member, a friend, or even a group of friends. At a minimum, it can be beneficial to be around other people in a public setting, whether it is to get coffee, eat a meal, watch a movie, go shopping, go to the beach, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>Practice compassion for others.</strong></p><p>Combat the blues by giving back to others in the community, for example through volunteer service. Acts of compassion can be uplifting for both the receiver and the giver. Helping someone, giving, or making something to share with others (i.e., baked goods, greeting cards, etc.) can produce feelings of fulfillment, connection and contribution.</p><p>Numerous studies have reported better health and greater longevity in people who are socially engaged.</p><p><em>If you feel burdened by feelings of loneliness or depression, schedule an appointment with a&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Behavioral Health</em></a><em>&nbsp;specialist at&nbsp;</em><a href=\"tel:1-904-376-3800\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.376.3800</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

No, not like Kevin McAllister, who waged a small war against bumbling home intruders around Christmastime in the movie &ldquo;Home Alone.&rdquo;</p><p>How old does your child need to be before you can run to the store while they finish up homework or enjoy some playtime?</p><p>Social workers in the study tended to agree that no child under the age of 12 should be left home alone. The experts surveyed also felt 13 is the general age when most children are mature enough to be responsible, not hurt themselves and react appropriately if they need something. <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatrician/dr-randolph-thornton-md\" target=\"_blank\">Randolph &quot;Randy&quot; Thornton, MD</a>, a pediatrician at Jacksonville Pediatrics and <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>, tends to agree.</p><p>&ldquo;Every child is different, but generally, I would say around 11 or 12 years old would be a safe age,&rdquo; Dr. Thornton said. &ldquo;There are people who leave them home alone earlier, but the biggest determinant is if the child is able to handle an emergency. A good way to think about it is, at what age do you think your child would make a good babysitter?&rdquo;</p><p>One way to test your child&#39;s readiness to be left home alone for a couple of hours is to run through some different scenarios together.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about maturity and how to handle an emergency. If the house is on fire, what do you do? If someone knocks on the door, what do you do? What would you do if you smelled smoke? Hopefully, their answer is, &lsquo;Get out of the house and call 911,&rsquo;&rdquo; Dr. Thornton said. &ldquo;You know your child the best and some may not be ready at 11 or 12, but that&rsquo;s a good rough estimate because they&rsquo;re usually able to handle an emergency.&rdquo;</p><p>Before leaving the house, be sure to run through a safety check. Ensuring everything dangerous is inaccessible is important, especially if there will be a younger child home alone with an older one.</p><p>&ldquo;My biggest concern would be firearms &mdash; make sure they&rsquo;re locked up,&rdquo; Dr. Thornton said. &ldquo;With children in the house at any age, make sure the ammunition is in a separate location and ensure there&rsquo;s a trigger lock at least or a case where the gun is locked up.</p><p>Also, make sure cleaning products and poisons are locked away, and that access to swimming pools is blocked, especially if younger children will be with the older children,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Imagine if you were babysitting a younger child and essentially childproof your house.&rdquo;</p><p>And lastly, give your child a dry run before stepping out for a couple of hours at a time. Maybe you watch TV in your bedroom for a few hours and have your child act as though you&rsquo;re not home. Dr. Thornton recommends trying a short trip out and checking in about how he or she did when you get home.</p><p>He recommended, &ldquo;Try small trips away, like running to the grocery store, and just see how they do. Were they too anxious or nervous? Go for a walk or a short night out and see how things go, then extend the time slowly.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Is your child ready to start staying home alone, or even babysitting?

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again: time to make our New Year&rsquo;s resolutions, those lofty goals we aim for and (probably) fail to achieve over the spring, then feel bad about over the summer, and then plan to actually achieve in the following year. Broken resolutions are so normal they are clich&eacute;. Why does this happen? Why do we aspire to some worthy goal and then not fulfill it?</p><p>I believe that when we don&rsquo;t achieve our resolutions, it&rsquo;s because something about them wasn&rsquo;t quite right.</p><p><strong>5 common reasons people fail to meet their goals</strong></p><ol><li><strong>The resolution represents something about ourselves we don&rsquo;t like</strong>. Trying to improve yourself by rejecting yourself leads nowhere. Resolutions rooted in self-criticism, guilt or shame don&rsquo;t honor who we are, and we will probably undermine them. For example, the age-old goal of losing weight in the New Year is often rooted in self-consciousness about our bodies rather than a place of loving our bodies and wanting to improve our health.</li><li><strong>It has an &ldquo;external locus of control.&rdquo;</strong> What&rsquo;s that? It&rsquo;s when we are motivated by forces outside ourselves. Coercion, pressure and even inspiration aren&rsquo;t enough to motivate us long-term. If we take on a goal that really belongs to someone else, we are unlikely to keep at it.</li><li><strong>The goal is inauthentic.&nbsp;</strong>That is, it doesn&rsquo;t reflect our identities, abilities, motivations, patterns and possibilities. When we make resolutions that don&rsquo;t reflect our own values, they&rsquo;re unlikely to stick. At best, they embody aspiration rather than true intention.</li><li><strong>It doesn&rsquo;t account for the pain of transformation.</strong> Resolutions tend to focus on the positive experience of victory and success. The fact is, change is hard and costly. Ignoring this in favor of positive thinking will leave us unable to deal with hardship, and we will fold under the challenge.</li><li><strong>We don&rsquo;t value staying the same.&nbsp;</strong>We have reasons for being the way we are, even if the way we are has its downsides. We resolve to make positive changes in our lives because of the value we see in the change. But without finding value in the way we are, and understanding why we behave in certain ways, we&rsquo;re undermining our ability to keep our resolutions.</li></ol><p>Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean our resolutions are doomed to fail, and self-improvement is important in many ways. The real question is this: How can we become more effective at making positive change?</p><p>We are most likely to engage in positive growth and change when we&rsquo;re internally motivated when the changes we seek align with our identity, and when the journey consists of small, attainable steps &mdash;with a lot of appreciation and encouragement along the way.</p><p><strong>8 best practices for developing effective resolutions for the New Year (or any time)</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Consider your motivations.&nbsp;</strong>Why do you want to undergo this change in your life? Is it because you &ldquo;should?&rdquo; Is it because your significant other, your employer, or your favorite health guru says it&rsquo;s the right thing to do? Or, is it because the change aligns with who you are, and who you want to become?</li><li><strong>Commit to micro-goals.</strong> How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. On any given day, we are usually unable to accomplish a massive, world-shaking change. But we can usually make a small modification to our lives. I call it &ldquo;micro-dosing goodness.&rdquo; A good thing, no matter how small, is still good. Maybe you won&rsquo;t run a marathon today, but what about walking to the mailbox and back, and enjoying the sunlight along the way? Tomorrow, it could be a walk around the block, then a jog, and so on.</li><li><strong>Make your goals sustainable.</strong> The resolutions we will keep are the ones we can sustain over a lifetime. Learning how a new diet and lifestyle affect your life will help you integrate them long-term moving forward. Take a vegetarian diet, for example. Maybe you can force yourself to only eat broccoli and tofu for a few days, or even a few weeks. But is it likely that you will do that for the rest of your life? Taking time to research vegetarian recipes and meat alternatives, while choosing to eat meatless a day or two each week at first, can help you research new ways of preparing meals and changes in your daily life to accommodate vegetarian eating.</li><li><strong>Add in something good.</strong> We haven&rsquo;t gone far enough if we only resolve to eliminate something negative. We also have to add in something positive. For instance, if you decide to watch less TV, what will you replace it with? What will help you relax, unwind and enjoy yourself? Unless you can fulfill through other means the good you find in watching TV, you&rsquo;ll eventually go back to watching too much TV.</li><li><strong>Think of your resolution as an experiment.</strong> Rembrandt did not start his artistic career painting masterpieces. Lindsey Stirling didn&rsquo;t play epic violin the first time she put bow to string. Don&rsquo;t consider it a failure if you try something and it doesn&rsquo;t work perfectly. Consider it an experiment. Allow yourself to try, fail, learn, refine and grow. If you want to exercise more in 2020, be willing to try weightlifting, yoga, running, cycling and other types of physical activity until you find the one you enjoy and that feels right for you.</li><li><strong>Commit to learning.</strong> If you are experimenting with change, try to glean as much as you can from the experience. Reflect: what does your experience teach you about yourself and others, about life and how you relate to it?</li><li><strong>Find accountability partners.</strong> We&rsquo;re better together than alone. Invite others on the journey as you seek to make meaningful changes in your life. Let other people who are supportive of you know what your goals are so they can encourage you along the way.</li><li><strong>Celebrate!</strong> Give yourself credit for each step you take, no matter how small. Be sure to reward yourself regularly, especially when you accomplish a major goal. Enjoy your success.</li></ol><p><em>Guest columnist&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/licensed-mental-health-counselor/craig-brown-lmhc\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Craig Brown, LHMC, LMFT</em></a><em>, is a licensed mental health counselor at Baptist Behavioral Health.

Once the hospital determined that Crofton had suffered a ruptured aneurysm, a life-threatening type of stroke caused by his blood infection, they immediately transferred him to the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-center\" target=\"_blank\">Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center</a> at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>.</p><p>Four days later, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/lyerly-neurosurgery\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Lyerly</a> neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-eric-sauvageau-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Sauvageau, MD</a>, co-director of the Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center, performed an endovascular procedure on Crofton known as flow diversion where soft metal coils are placed in the ruptured aneurysm, followed by a device that covers the hole.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1576689629/Juice/eric-sauvageau-md-8x10.jpg\" alt=\"Sauvageau\"></div><p>&ldquo;When we first arrived at Baptist, Dr. Sauvgeau said there was a real possibility Jay wouldn&rsquo;t survive,&rdquo; Brown recalled. &ldquo;I think he gave him something like a 10% chance of living.&rdquo;</p><p>A week later, after a second brain bleed left Crofton clinging to life, Dr. Sauvageau performed a second procedure to seal off the aneurysm.</p><p><strong>51 days in the hospital</strong></p><p>Brown remembers that touch-and-go night in November all too well. She was sleeping on a small couch in her son&rsquo;s intensive care unit room when all the alarms went off. In seconds, Crofton&rsquo;s bed was surrounded by about a dozen caregivers.</p><p>The day before, Crofton experienced brain vessel spasms, a complication following a ruptured aneurysm that can lead to further brain damage or even death.</p><p>Two weeks later, on Dec. 4, Crofton suffered a third brain bleed, necessitating yet another trip to the operating room.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when things really started to go downhill,&rdquo; said Brown, who took a leave of absence from her job so she could be at her son&rsquo;s bedside, 24/7. &ldquo;They actually brought a hospital chaplain in to sit with me that day.</p><p>&ldquo;The only time I went home was to take a shower and put on some new clothes,&rdquo; added Brown. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see Jay start making any real progress until right around Christmas.&rdquo;</p><p>In all, Crofton spent 51 days in the Neuro ICU before being discharged to Brooks Rehabilitation for two weeks of inpatient rehab. He followed that up with daily rehab visits for the next four months.</p><p><strong>Beating the odds</strong></p><p>Multiple brain bleeds were not the least of his worries.</p><p>In September 2016, Crofton underwent surgery at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-heart-hospital\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Hospital</a> to replace his aortic valve. Six months later, he had brain surgery at Baptist Jacksonville for a Chiari malformation that was discovered during the course of his lengthy aneurysm treatment. Chiari malformation is a congenital (present at birth) condition in which brain tissue extends into the spinal canal, interfering with the normal flow of the cerebrospinal fluid that protects the brain and spinal cord.</p><p>&ldquo;His Chiari malformation was causing a cyst to enlarge on his cervical spinal cord,&rdquo; said Dr. Sauvageau.</p><p>Finally, in October 2017, Crofton underwent surgery to drain the cyst and restore the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid. The procedure required a seven-day hospital stay.</p><p>Two months later, Crofton met an aspiring nurse named Whitney at a lakeside church retreat. The couple dated for two years before tying the knot this past November at an outdoor ceremony on Amelia Island.</p><p>After enduring six surgeries in three years, Crofton went back to school to earn an associate&rsquo;s degree and is now studying to be a hospital radiologic technologist. He and Whitney recently took a trip to Universal Studios in Orlando to ride the rollercoasters.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1576689628/Juice/Jay_photo.jpg\" alt=\"Jay_Crofton\"></div><p>Brown said her son is doing really well, considering all that he&rsquo;s been through. &ldquo;The nurses at Baptist were absolutely wonderful. And Dr. Sauvageau is a miracle worker,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Earlier this year, Crofton was awarded a blue ribbon by the Florida Society of Radiologic Technologists for a school project he did on brain aneurysms.</p><p>&ldquo;A few years ago, I didn&rsquo;t even know what aneurysms were, but now I can tell you all about them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have a few deficits, but nothing I can&rsquo;t live with.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Ever been told you&rsquo;re not supposed to put cotton swabs in your ears? Well, it&rsquo;s true. If you look at a box of Q-tips, it even has a warning not to insert their product into your ear canal. If their packaging is to be believed, cotton swabs are actually meant for removing cosmetics around the eyes, cleaning your keyboard, and doing other delicate tasks in tiny areas.</p><p>But despite the blatant labeling on the box, many people continue popping cotton swabs into their ears and swirling them around to remove wax. And otolaryngologists (also known as ENTs) have asked the world many times to knock it off.</p><p>These docs don&rsquo;t just have the hardest to spell title &mdash; they care for one of the body&rsquo;s most complex systems. So, it&rsquo;s not surprising there are a few common misunderstandings about how we should take care of our ears, noses and throats. <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/otolaryngologist-ent/dr-mary-czerny-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Czerny, MD</a>, a board-certified otolaryngologist (ENT) with Baptist ENT Specialists, spoke with Juice about four common questions asked by her patients, searched on the internet, and generally misunderstood by the public.</p><p><strong>Why am I not supposed to use cotton swabs to clean my ears?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&ldquo;The ears are a self-cleaning organ. There are fibers in the ear canal that help push wax and other debris out,&rdquo; Dr. Czerny explained. &ldquo;Q-tips override that mechanism and you end up pushing more wax in than you get out. Earwax has two helpful properties: one is that it&rsquo;s antibacterial and antifungal, and the second is that it protects your ears from debris getting into the deeper parts of the ear canal.</p><p>&ldquo;Some people overproduce earwax or have build-up due to wearing hearing aids, and we may see them in our office for removal,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;People can use wax-softening drops that are over-the-counter or even a few drops of mineral or baby oil to soften the wax.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>How are our sinuses and ears really connected, and why do they seem to share infections so easily?</strong></p><p>&ldquo;The Eustachian tube is how they&rsquo;re connected, which goes from the back part of the nose to the space behind the eardrum,&rdquo; Dr. Czerny said. &ldquo;Anything affecting the nose, like allergies or a sinus infection, can also cause swelling in the Eustachian tube, which leads to negative pressure and, sometimes, fluid in the ears. Bacteria and viruses can also migrate up the Eustachian tube, so that&rsquo;s how noninfected fluid can become a true middle ear infection.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s really the best way to unplug my ears after a flight?</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Do some of the things you might do on the plane, like yawn, chew gum or close your mouth, pinch your nose and try to blow out,&rdquo; Dr. Czerny explained. &ldquo;Doing this forces air up the Eustachian tube, which will let you equalize your pressure and relieve that full feeling. I tell a lot of my patients, if they have trouble with their ears or are traveling while sick, they can use a nasal or oral decongestant before or during the flight to try to prevent that congestion.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>My voice is always hoarse and it feels like there&rsquo;s something in my throat. What gives?</strong></p><p>&ldquo;We see a lot of patients coming in with throat complaints, like a hoarse voice, difficulty swallowing, sore throat, and feeling like something is in their throat. Many times, the source of this is acid reflux where the acid comes up to the top of the esophagus and gets onto the voice box. It&rsquo;s called laryngopharyngeal reflux, or LPR. LPR can occur even in people who have no heartburn or indigestion. It can present differently and sometimes be referred to as silent reflux. We can diagnose LPR with a specialized test in our office that helps determine which medication and dosage are likely to be effective.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you&rsquo;re concerned about the health of your ears, nose or throat,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-ent-specialists\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist ENT Specialists</em></a><em>&nbsp;are here to help.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-ent-specialists/request-appointment\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Schedule an appointment online</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

A recent study published in the American Academy of Emergency Medicine said pediatric patients are more at risk for hoverboard-related injuries than adults and almost 6% of ED visits involved critical injuries. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Fractures of the wrist, forearm and head account for about 40% of all hoverboard-related injuries, the study said, followed by contusions, sprains and strains. Other traumatic injuries typically seen in the ER during the holidays:</p><ul><li>Falls (ladders/slip and fall)</li><li>Burns (in particular from turkey fryer oil)</li><li>Lacerations (cooking/mandoline slicers)</li><li>Power tool-related injuries</li></ul><p>&ldquo;And, certainly, motor vehicle accidents reach a peak during the holidays because more people are on the road more, and traveling to and from parties where alcohol is served,&rdquo; Dr. Barrier added. &ldquo;Alcohol poisoning is definitely something we see in the ER around the holidays. Mental health-related visits, including depression, also increase during this time of the year.</p><p>&ldquo;On the non-traumatic side, we certainly experience a spike in respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia and bronchitis, that can result in admissions to the hospital. Increased sugar and salt in holiday foods can also worsen hypertension and congestive heart failure emergencies.&rdquo;</p><p>ERs tend to see an influx of patients the day after Christmas, sometimes because people tend to delay medical treatment until after the holidays.</p><p>&ldquo;We certainly encourage people to enjoy the hustle and bustle of the holidays,&rdquo; said Dr. Barrier, &ldquo;but we also want them to maintain their medical routines, including taking all their medicines and not ignoring any symptoms of illness.&rdquo;</p><p><em>All nine&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-emergency-rooms\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Health emergency rooms</em></a><em>&nbsp;are open 24/7, and estimated wait times are updated every 30 minutes.

But taking care of a spouse who is battling anxiety can be draining. Their worries can spill over into other aspects of your life and can in turn foster anxiety in you.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s critical to learn how to manage your partner&rsquo;s anxiety, and your own, so that you can both thrive, together.</p><p><strong>Validate and acknowledge your partner&rsquo;s feelings without patronizing them.</strong></p><p>Saying something like &ldquo;snap out of it&rdquo; will upset your partner&mdash;as the feelings they are having are often things they can&rsquo;t fully control. Encourage your partner to talk about their anxiety: what does it feel like, and how does it express itself? If he or she doesn&rsquo;t feel like talking, encourage your partner to write their anxious feelings down; that may help the thoughts leave their heads for a bit. Allow your partner to choose whether or not they share those written thoughts with you.</p><p><strong>Do mindful activities with your partner.</strong></p><p>Practice deep breathing, yoga, meditation, and stretching. Be patient with your partner and use these activities to show him or her that you want to focus on destressing, together.</p><p>There is a book called <em>The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook</em> you can work on with your partner. It has multiple exercises for those who need more structure in managing their anxiety. You can do some of the exercises together to get a better sense of what your partner is going through.</p><p><strong>Remind yourself of all of your partner&rsquo;s good qualities.</strong></p><p>You chose to spend your life with your partner knowing that they are anxious. Remind yourself of their other attractive qualities.</p><p><strong>Keep a journal of your own.</strong></p><p>Keep track of your own anxious thoughts and feelings to have a better understanding of what is triggering them.</p><p><strong>Practice compromise.</strong></p><p>For example, if you want to go to a concert but know your partner hates large crowds, find a smaller, more intimate venue that won&rsquo;t heighten their anxiety.</p><p><strong>Take a hike.</strong></p><p>No, that doesn&rsquo;t mean telling your partner to take a hike when they get anxious. Anxiety responds to exercise, so when you or your partner are feeling particularly anxious, it may be a good idea to take a walk, go for a run, or hit the gym.</p><p><strong>Encourage your partner to seek professional help if necessary.</strong></p><p>You can assist your partner in setting up an appointment and going to that first appointment with him or her.</p><p>The bottom line is your spouse&rsquo;s anxiety is a behavioral pattern that probably started long before you ever got together. We love our partners and know them pretty well, but we may have come into their lives 20 to 30 years after it got started, like walking into a movie halfway through.</p><p>We also have our own interests and our own faults.

His parents, Alexandria and Chrisshun Boddie, also are smiling as they celebrate the one-year &ldquo;smileaversary&rdquo; of Andrew&rsquo;s successful lip surgery.</p><p>Andrew had bilateral cleft lip surgery performed by <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/plastic-surgeon/dr-sarah-fernandez-md\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Fernandez, MD</a>, a pediatric plastic surgeon with the Snyder Family Cleft and Craniofacial Center at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville and Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville. A bilateral cleft lip occurs when the developing lip of the fetus fails to fuse, creating defects in the skin, muscle, and mucosa of the upper lip. It can also affect the nose.</p><p>&ldquo;From the beginning, they made sure that I had all of the tools and information I needed, giving me the knowledge and confidence that I needed so that I would know the best way to care for my baby,&rdquo; Alexandria said.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1575408673/Juice/Andrew_Boddie_1Cropped.jpg\" alt=\"Boddie\"></div><p>At 22 weeks, Alexandria&rsquo;s obstetrician detected a cleft lip condition near the baby&rsquo;s lip and mouth area during a routine ultrasound. Alexandria was referred to the Snyder Family Cleft and Craniofacial Center at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. The Center&rsquo;s Cleft Palate Team provided the Boddies with information about their son&rsquo;s condition, future treatment and care.</p><p>&ldquo;Cleft lip and palate patients have a unique set of needs that go beyond the surgical care involved,&rdquo; explained Dr. Fernandez. &ldquo;The gold standard of cleft care is an interdisciplinary team that can provide coordinated care. Our American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association (ACPA)-approved Team includes specialists from pediatrics, speech therapy, psychology, social services, nursing, otolaryngology, audiology, neurosurgery, oral maxillofacial surgery, craniofacial surgery, dental, and orthodontic backgrounds to ensure that these needs are met in a prompt, coordinated fashion. We are passionate about providing the best and most up-to-date care for our patients, and our team is active in both state and national craniofacial organizations to ensure we meet this goal.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Andrew was born, the Center&rsquo;s support team helped Alexandria understand what to expect. They provided a treatment plan overview and explained the concept of team care. They discussed the special feeding needs of a newborn born with a cleft and demonstrated specialty feeding systems. When Andrew was born at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville, the support team arrived shortly after to provide Alexandria and her new baby with feeding support, cleft education and specific treatment planning. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Even though I&rsquo;m a nurse, I had never experienced anything like this before,&rdquo; Alexandria said.</p><p><strong>Preparing for surgery</strong></p><p>At four months, Andrew had a cleft lip repair performed by Dr. Fernandez at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;In Andrew&rsquo;s case, the width of his cleft meant that many of the central lip structures were quite small, requiring us to be creative with the design of the repair,&rdquo; said Dr. Fernandez. &ldquo;His premaxilla, the central portion of his upper jaw, was also pushed forward which created a challenge in repairing his orbicularis muscle. In many bilateral cleft lip cases, this situation requires a two-stage repair. Fortunately, we were able to achieve a single-stage repair for Andrew.&rdquo;</p><p>In addition to the lip surgery, Andrew had palate surgery in February 2019. The Boddies are grateful to have received exceptional medical and surgical care close to home.</p><p>&ldquo;The entire team has been great throughout the process,&rdquo; Alexandria said. &ldquo;It has been wonderful to have their support.&rdquo;</p><p><em>The&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/cleft-and-craniofacial-center\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Snyder Family Cleft and Craniofacial Center at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</em></a><em>&nbsp;is an ACPA-approved Team and has met the Standards of Team Care for Cleft and Craniofacial Teams set by the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association (ACPA).&nbsp;</em><em>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital&rsquo;s regional program is one of 112 in the country, seven in Florida and two in Georgia to have earned this approval.&nbsp;</em><em>The Snyder Family Cleft and Craniofacial Center at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital receives generous support from the Edward and Lizbeth Snyder Pediatric Cleft and Craniofacial Conditions Endowment.</em></p>",

Genetic testing has become much less expensive and is often covered by insurance plans as well.</li></ul><p>Early detection is another way to spot cancer before symptoms appear. This includes annual mammograms and periodic Pap smears and HPV testing for women and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test screenings for men.</p><p>If any of these symptoms do appear and last for more than two to three weeks, talk to your physician because symptoms of cancer generally persist and even get worse over time, according to Dr. Pezzi. &nbsp;Some symptoms, like unexpected bleeding, need to be reported right away.</p><p>&ldquo;There are going to be a lot of false alarms, but that&rsquo;s OK.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/wellness/are-fad-diets-bad-diets\" target=\"_blank\">Mediterranean diet</a> has been praised for its ability to keep illness at bay, like lowering the risk of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/wellness/tell-your-heart-olive-you\" target=\"_blank\">heart conditions</a>, type 2 diabetes, Parkinson&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s. And now, it has even been linked to reducing the risk of gestational diabetes. But when should an expectant mama begin eating this way? And do OB-GYNs really recommend the Mediterranean diet to their pregnant patients?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/obstetrician-and-gynecologist/dr-tiffany-wells-md\" target=\"_blank\">Tiffany Wells, MD</a>, an OB/GYN at River City OBGYN and Baptist Health, says this way of eating is something she believes in for anyone, pregnant or not.</p><p>&ldquo;People hear diabetes and they think, &lsquo;Oh my goodness, I&rsquo;m going to have to give myself shots of insulin.&rsquo; Most of the time, patients can manage it with diet or oral medicine. There are other things you can do to manage it prior to getting to that step,&rdquo; said Dr. Wells. &ldquo;I talk to my pregnant and non-pregnant patients about the Mediterranean diet all the time. You&rsquo;re focusing on your protein coming from poultry and fish rather than red meat. You&rsquo;re choosing good fats rather than butter, whole grains over white potatoes, and prioritizing vegetables. It&rsquo;s a heart-healthy diet and is always at the top of the best diet lists. It&rsquo;s not as restrictive as other diets so it&rsquo;s easy to maintain, especially when you&rsquo;re pregnant.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>An ounce of prevention</strong></p><p>Taking preventive measures, like choosing a doctor-approved, healthy diet, is especially important for women with a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes.</p><p>&ldquo;A big risk factor is obesity, as well as a history of having gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy,&rdquo; Dr. Wells explains. &ldquo;Being 35 and older, and having a family history of diabetes, especially type 2, also put you at increased risk. With those women, we&rsquo;d take a look at their diet &mdash; not looking to calorie restrict, but also watching your carbohydrate intake. In pregnancy, when you&rsquo;re feeling sick, that can be difficult. I tell them to stick with lean meats, fruits and vegetables, and exercising to help bring down our risk of gestational diabetes.&rdquo;</p><p>And, as with any healthy diet choice, exercise goes hand in hand. Most exercises are safe while pregnant, and can encourage a healthy pregnancy while reducing the chances of gestational diabetes.</p><p>&ldquo;As far as exercise, a lot of your standard things you do in a gym will be fine, like using the treadmill, weightlifting, and riding the stationary bike,&rdquo; says Dr. Wells. &ldquo;I tell people to avoid things that will throw them off balance and anything that will put increased pressure on the pelvis. Most standard programs will be fine unless your physician tells you differently.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Diet and morning sickness</strong></p><p>Since the Mediterranean diet isn&rsquo;t a carb-heavy way of eating, women in their first trimester may have some difficulty when it comes to dealing with their nausea. Certain textures and smells aren&rsquo;t appealing either. Dr. Wells encourages her patients to do their best to deal with morning sickness and find foods that will stay down.</p><p>&ldquo;I think early on, women have difficulty with either the texture or smell of meat, so it&rsquo;s a matter of finding good protein sources. Their sense of smell can make it tough to eat some foods, so test around to find what you can tolerate and what you can&rsquo;t. Often the morning sickness improves, so do what you can for calories in the first trimester, then reassess to eat healthily in the second.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Monitoring your health</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s important for pregnant women to keep the signs and symptoms of gestational diabetes and mind, and know their risk. It&rsquo;s not always obvious when you have it, so keeping an eye out for increased thirst, more frequent urination can be the first sign. If you&rsquo;re concerned about gestational diabetes before the standard testing, which occurs between 24 and 28 weeks, be sure to discuss this your OB.</p><p>&ldquo;With gestational diabetes, it&rsquo;s not always obvious you have it,&quot; said Dr. Wells. &quot;Certainly, increased thirst or urination could be a tip-off, but those are signs of pregnancy as well and therefore hard to rely on. But we test for gestational diabetes, and if someone is at an increased risk we&rsquo;ll do testing earlier in their pregnancy. Otherwise, standard testing is between 24 and 28 weeks, which is usually when we find out.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you&rsquo;re looking for a provider who can help you manage gestational diabetes, call <a href=\"tel:1-904-202-4437\" target=\"_blank\">904.202.4her (4437)</a> to make an appointment.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Winter brings cooler temperatures, cozy nights inside, hot chocolate and other delights of the season. But with each dip in the temperature, ready or not, the dreaded flu season is here.</p><p>Not only does the flu lead to physical misery and missed school, work and vacations, it can also cause serious problems, especially for babies, toddlers, the elderly and pregnant women. It&rsquo;s important to avoid the flu at all costs, not just for yourself, but for your family and those around you. If you&rsquo;re pregnant, you may worry about what remedies and preventive measures you can safely take to fight the flu.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How can I avoid the flu?</strong></p><p>The best way to treat the flu is to never get it in the first place, and getting a flu shot is the best means of prevention. Not only is it safe for pregnant women, but it&#39;s also recommended by the CDC, physicians and specialists who care for pregnant women. The flu shot protects pregnant women and unborn babies and even protects a baby for about 6 months after he or she is born. Since babies cannot get a flu shot until 6 months of age, having a flu shot while pregnant means mom will share the protective antibodies from the vaccine with her baby.</p><p><strong>Why is the flu shot so important?</strong></p><p>Pregnant women have a higher risk of complications from the flu. Pregnancy can increase the severity of flu symptoms and pregnant women are more likely to require hospitalization due to complications.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a flu shot reduces your chances of getting the flu and minimizes the flu&rsquo;s severity, should you get a strain not covered by the vaccine.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It is not only important to get children immunized against influenza, but also others who are around them so that children can be &lsquo;cocooned,&rsquo; especially those who cannot get vaccine for any reason and those who may not respond to the vaccine,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-infectious-disease-specialist/dr-mobeen-rathore-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mobeen Rathore, MD</a>, chief of pediatric infectious disease and immunology for Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p><strong>Is the flu shot safe?</strong></p><p>The flu vaccine has been used safely by millions of pregnant women without known problems to the mother or child. Flu vaccines are made according to the highest standards and developed after years of testing. No evidence exists connecting vaccines with thimerosal to the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Thimerosal is a preservative that protects multi-dose flu shots from contamination with bacteria or germs. You can always request a flu shot made without thimerosal, which comes in single-dose vials.</p><p>The flu shot can make you feel slightly sick or produce soreness or redness in the injection area. These side effects, as unpleasant as they may be, outweigh the risks of potential complications of the flu. The flu shot is safe to have at any point during pregnancy.</p><p><em>There&rsquo;s a lot to think about when you&rsquo;re pregnant, but we&rsquo;re here to help!

They split their time between the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/cancer\" target=\"_blank\">oncology&nbsp;</a>floor, where their then-2-year-old son, Liam, was being treated for leukemia, and the Level IV <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/supporting-services/nicu\" target=\"_blank\">Neonatal ICU</a>, with their twin girls, who had been born at just 33 weeks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Round one with cancer</strong></p><p>Liam, now 9, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) just two weeks before twins Emma and Ella, now 6, were born. ALL is the most common type of childhood cancer, peaking in children ages 3 to 5.</p><p>&ldquo;Liam had a big, swollen lymph node on his neck that was the size of a ping pong ball,&rdquo; Will Smith said. &ldquo;He complained almost to the point of tears when he fell down because his joints hurt so badly. So we brought him to his pediatrician and they ran a very basic blood test and could immediately tell something was wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Smith brought Liam to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital&rsquo;s main <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/emergency\" target=\"_blank\">Emergency Center</a> downtown, where a more extensive blood test revealed the leukemia diagnosis.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a gut punch,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;There are a lot of things someone can tell you about your kid that you can get through or rationalize in your head. But when someone tells you your child has cancer, your mind just starts racing to every possibility, and it goes to the worst things first.&rdquo;</p><p>Liam was immediately admitted Wolfson Children&rsquo;s to begin treatment. Twins Emma and Ella spent around six weeks in the NICU before they were able to go home.</p><p>As the twins grew up, Liam continued what ended up being three years of treatment for his leukemia. But as he was nearing the finishing line, the Smith family was about to start all over.</p><p><strong>Round two</strong></p><p>Emma and Ella were also 2 years old when Will and Lacey started to notice some concerning symptoms in Emma that were eerily similar to what they had seen in Liam.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure enough, she was diagnosed with the exact same leukemia Liam was being treated for,&rdquo; Smith said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-hematologist-oncologist/dr-scott-bradfield-md\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Bradfield, MD</a>, chief of pediatric hematology/oncology at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and associate division chief of hematology/oncology for Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, had already gotten to know the Smith family through Liam&rsquo;s course of treatment.</p><p>&ldquo;We spend lots of stressful times with these families and get to know them very well, which made it even harder when they came back with Emma,&rdquo; Dr. Bradfield said. &ldquo;It was painful in a different way. We almost always are meeting families for the first time when we&rsquo;re telling them that their child has cancer, but to do it with a family that you have been through this with before and know that it&rsquo;s the same thing again, it&rsquo;s hard.&rdquo;</p><p>While about 40 children per every million will be diagnosed with ALL, according to Dr. Bradfield, the risk is two-to-four times higher for siblings of a child who has been diagnosed. For identical twins, the risk is markedly higher.</p><p>&ldquo;I think there was a dread among the family and the providers that Ella was going to get it, too,&rdquo; Dr. Bradfield said.</p><p>The family and care team made the decision to have Ella undergo routine blood testing.</p><p>&ldquo;Every week we would go, and Emma and Liam would get infusions while Ella got her blood checked to make sure there was no sign of leukemia,&rdquo; Smith said.</p><p><strong>Victory comes in threes</strong></p><p>Liam completed his treatment in 2016 and Emma completed her treatment, which lasted about two-and-a-half years, in September of 2017. Both have been cancer-free ever since, but return for regular blood tests to make sure it hasn&rsquo;t come back.</p><p>Dr. Bradfield said at this point, the kids have a 92% chance the cancer will never return. After five years with no sign of cancer, they will be considered cured. Fortunately, Ella&rsquo;s blood tests have never shown any signs of leukemia. Once she turned 6, her risk returned to normal for siblings of children previously diagnosed, Dr. Bradfield said.</p><p>&ldquo;Even though Ella never got leukemia, she went through everything with us,&rdquo; Smith said. &ldquo;She told me recently how proud she was that Emma and Liam didn&rsquo;t have cancer anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Bradfield said the Smith family&rsquo;s cases show that there&rsquo;s more childhood cancer research that needs to be done revolving around whether there is a genetic component to leukemia.</p><p>&ldquo;For all of the children we treat for cancer, this is a story that really stands out in my memory,&rdquo; Dr. Bradfield said.</p><p>Today, Liam enjoys playing football while Emma and Ella are looking forward to trying dance and gymnastics.</p><p>&ldquo;This whole experience has made them extremely close,&rdquo; Smith said. &ldquo;I do feel like they got robbed of some time in their childhood, though, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to making that up.&rdquo;</p><p><em>On January 25, 2020, all three Smith children received medals as part of the&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrenschallenge.com/race-info/why-55\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson 55</a> - 55 children chosen to represent the wide range of specialties provided at Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital -&nbsp;</em><em>for the 2020&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrenschallenge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Challenge</a>.

Her insurance covered it, and the procedure offered a more accurate, detailed scan than a traditional 2D mammogram.</p><p>Silva&rsquo;s decision to get the mammogram rather than waiting another six months paid off.

You know what&rsquo;s not so appetizing? Thinking about how many calories we&rsquo;ll eat at this annual festival of food.</p><p><strong>Chew on this</strong></p><p>According to <em>Consumer Reports</em>, Americans will eat anywhere from 3,000 to 4,500 calories at Thanksgiving dinner alone.</p><p>&ldquo;As a physician, in particular one who sees and treats obesity on a daily basis, I wish this weren&rsquo;t the case, but it&#39;s not surprising to me,&rdquo; said Tristan Imhof, MD, a family medicine physician with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a>. &ldquo;It&#39;s no secret that obesity continues to have a grasp on this nation and is responsible for a host of preventable diseases, from high blood pressure to heart disease to diabetes.&rdquo;</p><p>Like most of us, Dr. Imhof admits to indulging annually on Thanksgiving. However, he says it&rsquo;s vital to stay mindful of the quantity and quality of food he eats to minimize the impact on his body. The issue isn&rsquo;t just about eating thousands of calories in one sitting, Dr. Imhof said. It&rsquo;s when overeating becomes a habit.</p><p>&ldquo;It points to a larger problem of obesity as those who don&#39;t exercise restraint at the Thanksgiving table may be unlikely to exercise restraint elsewhere,&rdquo; Dr. Imhof said. &ldquo;The problem starts when one sitting becomes five sittings, which becomes once a week and then becomes the norm.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Be thankful for your health</strong></p><p>The body isn&rsquo;t designed to take in so many high-calorie, high-fat foods at one time. Dr. Imhof warns that changes to the body take place when someone overindulges in meals typical of Thanksgiving that could trigger life-threatening conditions in people who have already existing health conditions, many times caused by years of poor eating habits.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not uncommon after someone eats this type of meal that we see increases in blood pressure, edema or swelling, and high blood sugar, all of which, when left uncontrolled, can trigger a life-threatening event like a heart attack or stroke,&rdquo; Dr. Imhof said.</p><p><strong>The worst offenders</strong></p><p>According to <em>The Healthy</em>, a wellness website from the publishers of <em>Reader&rsquo;s Digest</em>, these holiday foods are the worst for your health:</p><ul><li><strong>Apple pie</strong> - This holiday favorite typically has a buttery crust and sugary fillings. According to <em>The Healthy</em>, one slice of apple pie has more calories than a plate of turkey breast with gravy, buttery corn on the cob and a glass of red wine! If you plan to have a slice of pie and want to cut back on calories, make some healthier swaps earlier in the meal. For example, trade your mashed potatoes for spinach.</li><li><strong>Stuffing&nbsp;</strong>- Many agree this is the star of the side dishes. What makes it so good? Well, it&rsquo;s essentially just bread, butter and sometimes sausage. That means it&rsquo;s high in calories and fat. The good news? Cooking your stuffing outside the turkey can cut down on calories (and it&rsquo;s safer), and adding vegetables like mushrooms, onions and celery will boost your fiber intake.</li><li><strong>Mashed potatoes</strong> - The problem here isn&rsquo;t so much the potatoes themselves, but everything that gets mashed in with them. Many recipes call for whole milk, butter and even cheese and bacon. To reduce calories and fat, just use milk.</li></ul><p><strong>Food for thought</strong></p><p>None of this means that you should clear out those pantries or start a new tradition of &ldquo;Thanksgiving salad.&rdquo; All it means, Dr. Imhof said, is to be mindful of what you&rsquo;re eating and make sure it doesn&rsquo;t become a regular pattern.</p><p>&ldquo;It&#39;s acceptable to enjoy some of the things you don&#39;t typically have on a daily basis, but still do so in a responsible manner,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Pay attention to quantity and don&#39;t eat to a point of discomfort. When your body gives you the signal that it&#39;s time to stop, don&#39;t continue to eat until you&rsquo;re uncomfortable.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Over the summer, the Supreme Court announced that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg completed three weeks of radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer and required no further treatment.</p><p>Justice Ginsburg&rsquo;s cancer was discovered during a routine blood test. A biopsy confirmed a malignant tumor.</p><p><strong>Are there risk factors for pancreatic cancer?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/colon-and-rectal-surgeon/dr-ron-landmann-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ron G. Landmann, MD, FACS, FASCRS</a>, chief of colon and rectal surgery for Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center, said smoking is one risk factor for pancreatic cancer, but according to news reports, Justice Ginsburg isn&rsquo;t a smoker.</p><p>Pancreatic cancer occurs most frequently in people over age 45, men, Ashkenazi Jews, and African Americans. Some patients may be predisposed to getting pancreatic cancer based on a history of other health issues, including obesity and diabetes. Some may also develop pancreatic cancer when existing cancer returns or spreads, otherwise known as metastatic disease. Other risk factors include:</p><ul><li>Inherited genetic syndromes such as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer</li><li>Familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome (FAMMM)</li><li>Familial pancreatitis</li><li>Lynch Syndrome, a hereditary cancer syndrome that leads to a higher cancer risk</li><li>Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, a genetic condition that leads to an increased risk of intestinal cancers</li></ul><p>&ldquo;In all cases, treatment is usually individualized based on the patient&#39;s overall status and function and past medical and surgical therapies,&rdquo; Dr. Landmann said. &ldquo;Most primary pancreatic cancers do not manifest until they are more advanced or found incidentally during workup for other symptoms.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Jeopardy</em> host Alex Trebek, for example, was <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/cancer/jeopardy-host-reveals-cancer-diagnosis\" target=\"_blank\">diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer</a> in March and underwent treatment that wrapped up in August.</p><p>Dr. Landmann said many cancers, including pancreatic, are only found when an individual goes in for a CT scan ordered by their doctor for other symptoms or severe pain. Other signs and symptoms that may appear in some people include:</p><ul><li>Floating stools or white/discolored stools</li><li>Jaundice and yellowing or itchiness of the skin caused by elevated bilirubin levels. Bilirubin is formed during the breakdown of red blood cells and is normally processed through the liver.</li></ul><p>There is no screening for pancreatic cancer, but the management of the disease has significantly and rapidly evolved with the increasing use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (administered before surgery or other treatments) and radiation therapy, which is used to shrink the tumor before surgery and assess tumor biology. Preventive measures can also be taken to reduce the risk for pancreatic cancer, including eating a healthy diet and leading an active lifestyle.</p><p>&ldquo;If a person is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, it is imperative that they are evaluated and managed at a site that has a multidisciplinary team of physicians including surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, diagnostic and interventional radiologists, pathologists, geneticists, gastroenterologists and social workers to maximize both patient care, survival and quality of life,&rdquo; Dr. Landmann said. &ldquo;Baptist MD Anderson has these specialized multidisciplinary teams in place to provide the most contemporary and personalized treatment for our patients.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you or a loved one needs a cancer specialist, please call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"tel:1-904-202-7300\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.202.7300</em></a><em>&nbsp;or visit <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center?utm_source=vanity&utm_medium=tv&utm_campaign=cancer%20demands%202018\" target=\"_blank\">BaptistMDAnderson.com</a>.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Pregnant women go through many changes, some of which can cause blood sugar to get too high, putting both mom and baby at risk for problems. Gestational diabetes is diabetes that happens only during pregnancy. The diagnosis can be daunting, but gestational diabetes can be managed with the right care.</p><p><strong>When will I know if I have gestational diabetes?</strong></p><p>Most pregnant women will be tested for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks. During the test, the mom-to-be will be asked to drink a sugary solution and have her blood sugar levels tested about an hour later. This test helps determine how the body manages sugar and carbohydrates and will help doctors find out if a woman is at risk for gestational diabetes.</p><p><strong>What are the risks?</strong></p><p>If you have gestational diabetes, your baby may be born too early or have breathing problems. Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes also have a higher chance of getting diabetes themselves or being overweight as kids. Expectant mothers with gestational diabetes have a higher risk of preeclampsia, a serious type of high blood pressure during pregnancy. Diabetes later in life is also a risk. As many as one in 20 pregnant women develop gestational diabetes.</p><p><strong>What should I do if I have gestational diabetes?</strong></p><p>Your doctor will create a plan to help you keep your blood sugar levels in a healthy range. You may be advised to:</p><ul><li>Follow special meal plans</li><li>Exercise</li><li>Keep weight gain within a suggested range</li><li>Take insulin, if your doctor prescribes it</li></ul><p><strong>What happens after the baby is born?</strong></p><p>Your care team will give you the next steps following the birth of your child. Generally, this includes checking your blood sugar several times after the baby is born (not every day), to make sure your blood sugar has returned to a non-diabetic range.</p><p>&ldquo;Gestational diabetes is one of the most common complications of pregnancy,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/obstetrician-and-gynecologist/dr-laura-peter-do\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Peter, DO</a>, an obstetrician with Beaches OB/GYN and <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-beaches\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Beaches</a>. &ldquo;With this condition, knowledge is power and women should know they can have a big impact on the disease progression.

Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be controlled.</p><p><strong>Coughing, wheezing, sneezing and more</strong></p><p>Because asthma can be controlled, it&rsquo;s critical for asthma educators to help families understand what asthma control looks likes for each individual child. Asthma warning signs can vary from child to child and season to season. Common warning signs that we always hear about are coughing, wheezing and sneezing, but there are many others. For example, a flare of eczema can be a sign of asthma.</p><p>If you are a caregiver for an asthmatic child, it&rsquo;s important to understand your child&rsquo;s individual warning signs.</p><p>Oftentimes, a child who rarely experiences asthma symptoms will end up in the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/supporting-services/picu\" target=\"_blank\">Pediatric Intensive Care Unit</a> (PICU) at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, seemingly out of nowhere, for severe asthma exacerbation, or progressive worsening of symptoms. These children are the ones we worry about the most.</p><p><strong>3 questions to ask yourself about your child&rsquo;s asthma</strong></p><ul><li>Does your child take his or her rescue inhaler more than <strong>two times per week?&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Does your child awaken at night with coughing more than<strong>&nbsp;two times per month?</strong></li><li>Do you refill your child&rsquo;s quick-relief inhaler more than<strong>&nbsp;two times per year?</strong></li></ul><p>If the answer is yes to one or more of those questions, your child&rsquo;s asthma is NOT controlled.</p><p><strong>Under control?</strong></p><p>Using a daily controller inhaler, if prescribed by your child&rsquo;s provider, is very important to achieve asthma control. This medication should be taken every morning or night, no matter what. I sing songs, make up rhymes and have even set a child&rsquo;s phone to a certain ring tone to help them remember! I do whatever it takes for the child and parent to remember to use the controller medication daily.</p><p>It seems simple, but parents commonly only use this medication for just a few days after the asthma attack or only when their child is having issues. There is a difference between rescue medication and controller medication. Make sure you understand the benefits of both medications. When in doubt, ASK!</p><p>CAP-W currently coordinates care for 122 high-risk asthmatic patients at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. To be considered high-risk, a child must have had one PICU admission, two hospital admissions or four ER visits within 12 months. We reach out to the families every three months to provide support and resources in an effort to continue reducing asthma ER visits and hospital admissions.</p><p><em>Asthma workshops with&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/health-and-wellness/asthma-support\" target=\"_blank\"><em>CAP-W</em></a><em>&nbsp;are offered to anyone in the Jacksonville area who has a child with asthma.

But all that buzzing, zapping and pinging could damage a child&rsquo;s hearing.</p><p>Children and teens exposed to loud sounds for long periods of time are at risk for noise-induced hearing loss.</p><p>&ldquo;The best way to prevent noise-induced hearing loss is to avoid exposure to excessive noise,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-otolaryngologist-ent/dr-angela-black-md\" target=\"_blank\">Angela Black, MD</a>, a pediatric ear, nose and throat physician with Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care and Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital. &ldquo;Loud noise can cause hearing loss, and the damage can be permanent.&rdquo;</p><p>Sound levels are measured in decibels. The higher the decibel number, the louder the sound. According to the National Institutes of Health, repeated exposure to sound over 85 decibels can cause permanent hearing loss. A noisy restaurant, heavy traffic, and power lawnmower produce sounds around 85 decibels. Using devices with earphones at maximum volume can generate more than 100 decibels, loud enough to cause permanent hearing damage.</p><p>Dr. Black, who sees patients at Nemours and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville, and also at the Wolfson Children&#39;s Specialty Center in Lake City, recommends parents pay attention to the sound levels in their children&rsquo;s activities.</p><p>&ldquo;To protect your child&rsquo;s hearing, listen to the sound before purchasing a toy or game, and limit the amount of exposure,&rdquo; said Dr. Black. &ldquo;You can measure how loud a toy is with a decibel meter or an app on your phone.&rdquo;</p><p>Animated toys are one of the most common ways young children are exposed to excessive noise. Although they are designed to stimulate children, many toys can be dangerously loud. Some toys, including rattles, squeaky toys and musical toys, have been reported to emit sounds measuring over 110 decibels, which is comparable to power tools.</p><p>When purchasing toys, look for ones with volume control or an off/on button. Remove the batteries or cover the speaker with tape to reduce the sound.</p><p>&ldquo;Lower the volume when possible,&rdquo; said Dr. Black. &ldquo;If you can hear a child&rsquo;s device from across a room, it&rsquo;s too loud.&rdquo;</p><p>For older children and teens, potential sources of extreme noise volume include listening to music, playing computer games and using headphones. Dr. Black recommends parents set a limit for how long children can listen to music or play video games and how loud they can turn up the volume.</p><p>When using headphones or earbuds, listen at half the maximum volume and limit exposure to no more than 30 minutes in an eight-hour period. If available, limit a device&rsquo;s maximum sound volume and lock it in place through a parental control setting. If the device is not equipped with this feature, there are several app options available online.</p><p>&ldquo;When it comes to loud sound, the general rule is the greater the volume, the shorter the acceptable duration,&rdquo; said Dr. Black. &ldquo;Listening to music too loud, for several hours a day, will result in inevitable hearing loss.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you have questions about protecting your child&rsquo;s hearing, the specialists at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital encourage you to discuss with your pediatrician.

Parents and teens alike hold tight to those images as they hug each other goodbye, many for the first time ever. Many teens will thrive in college, but just as many will struggle adjusting to the new lifestyle. And that&rsquo;s nothing to be ashamed of.</p><p><strong>New classes, new friends, new you</strong></p><p>College can lead to an overload of new situations to which teens have to adapt, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-cathleen-connolly-phd\" target=\"_blank\">Cathy Connolly, PhD</a>, a psychologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;Academically, they are managing their own classes and may also feel more pressure about their workload because it ties into their careers and future work,&rdquo; said Dr. Connolly. &ldquo;Socially, teens may feel homesick because they are on their own for the first time. They also have to manage new responsibilities, such as waking up on their own, studying, taking medications, doing laundry, making healthy food choices and deciding when to go to sleep. This can be overwhelming.&rdquo;</p><p>Not to mention having to make new friends and adjust to life with a roommate in a tiny dorm room.</p><p>Dr. Connolly also cautioned that college is a time when many young adults have the &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; to navigate their own limits on drinking alcohol, going out with friends and playing video games, while balancing sleep and studying. The perfect balance can be hard to find, and many students will only learn theirs through trial and error.</p><p><strong>A sobering statistic</strong></p><p>Each student is different, with some more likely to reach out for help if they&rsquo;re struggling with mental health than others.</p><p>A recent ABC News report shines light on the darker side of what many call &ldquo;the best years of your life.&rdquo; According to the report, while suicide is the 10th-leading cause of death across the United States population, it is the second-leading cause among college-aged students.</p><p>&ldquo;When I work with teens transitioning to college, I make sure to help them look up the college counseling center and talk through signs of when they should go to talk to someone,&rdquo; Dr. Connolly said. &ldquo;Many college counseling centers offer typical counseling but will also have walk-in hours for students in crisis. Some offer workshop or presentations.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Know the signs</strong></p><p>It can be difficult to tell what&rsquo;s going on in a teenager&rsquo;s head when he or she is living under your roof. But it&rsquo;s even more difficult once they&rsquo;re out of the house. What&rsquo;s the best way to give your child freedom, while remaining in touch with his or her mental health?</p><p>Dr. Connolly recommended parents build a relationship with open lines of communication before the child leaves for college. Parents also need to understand what&rsquo;s realistic to expect from their child: some students may check in daily, while others may only do so once a week. Dr. Connolly encourages teens to maintain verbal communication, whether through a phone call or video chat, with their parents at least weekly.</p><p>&ldquo;That way, the parent can ask how it&rsquo;s going a few weeks in, and suggest going by the counseling center if things seem amiss,&rdquo; Dr. Connolly said.</p><p>Changes in behavior that last more than a couple weeks could signal that your child needs professional help. These include:</p><ul><li>Changes in appetite or sleep that he or she may mention in conversation</li><li>Changes in how he or she handles emotions, such as irritability, frustration, tearfulness or anxiety that seems disproportionate to the situation</li><li>Difficulty attending classes due to low energy, sleep issues or anxiety</li><li>A tendency to stay in his or her room or loss of interest in typical hobbies or interests</li><li>Physical symptoms like persistent headaches or stomachaches</li><li>Difficulty focusing or concentrating</li><li>Feelings of worthlessness</li><li>Thoughts about suicide or self-harming behaviors, like cutting</li></ul><p><strong>Take your time</strong></p><p>College is an adjustment for all new students. Dr. Connolly warns teens she counsels that they will likely experience ups and downs for the first two semesters.</p><p>&ldquo;I ask them to be patient with themselves,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;They need to understand what is healthy in terms of sleeping, eating and working out.

Burkett did her homework, researching Dr. Smith on her own as well. After realizing the depth of Dr. Smith&rsquo;s experience treating thyroid cancer, she was sold.</p><p>Dr. Smith told Burkett that he would need to remove her thyroid, as well as the lymph nodes along her windpipe, to make sure there was no cancer in them. Based upon the extent of the tumor in the tissues removed during surgery, he would evaluate the need for additional treatment with radioactive iodine therapy, directed by the radiation oncology and endocrinology teams at Baptist MD Anderson.</p><p>On the day of the surgery, Dr. Smith stopped by to talk with Burkett before the procedure. Her mom and husband had just stepped out, and it was just the two of them in her room. She was trying to stay strong and brave for everyone else, but on the inside, she was terrified. She grabbed Dr. Smith&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You promise you&rsquo;ll take good care of me?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Burkett was confident in the care Dr. Smith would provide. He made her feel comfortable and put her at ease, and, after their conversation, she knew she was going to be okay.</p><p>The surgery was in April, and Burkett is now cancer-free. She continues to go in for routine screenings, and she&rsquo;s back to her exercise routine of running, walking and doing her BodyPump class at the YMCA.</p><p>She says she felt that God was in her corner after her successful treatment, and she hopes to inspire others by continuing to share her story, especially because thyroid cancer is the most common cancer in women ages 20 to 34</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just very grateful,&rdquo; Burkett said. &ldquo;I hope that by sharing my story, I can help someone else.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you have a question about a <a href=\"https://www.mdanderson.org/cancer-types/thyroid-cancer.html\" target=\"_blank\">thyroid cancer sign or symptom</a> that concerns you, talk to your doctor.

I was literally covered in sweat. I thought I was going to pass out,&rdquo; said Burch, a 55-year-old Atlantic Beach resident who occasionally has migraines, but nothing earth shattering.</p><p>&ldquo;I put one hand against a wall thinking it was the floor. That&rsquo;s how disoriented I was.&rdquo;</p><p>Two days later, Burch went to see her primary care physician, who recommended a brain MRI. The scan revealed an unruptured aneurysm, a balloon-like bulge in one of her brain arteries, measuring 7.7 millimeters, or about the size of a large pencil eraser.</p><p>The aneurysm was located in the anterior communicating artery (Acom), a blood vessel that connects two cerebral arteries at the front of the brain. Acom aneurysms are among the most common and tend to rupture when they are relatively small.</p><p>Before the aneurysm was discovered, Burch had made plans for a spring vacation in Europe with her family.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could have waited that long to be treated,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like rolling the dice.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Odds in her favor</strong></p><p>After weighing her treatment options, Burch made an appointment with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-ricardo-hanel-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ricardo Hanel</a>, MD, PhD, co-director of the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-center\" target=\"_blank\">Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center</a> at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Jacksonville</a>.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"hanel\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1572533993/Juice/ricardo-hanel-md-8x10_Baptist.jpg\"></div><p>&ldquo;She had an irregular aneurysm in a location known for a high risk of bleeding,&rdquo; said Dr. Hanel, who specializes in ground-breaking endovascular surgery that can be performed from inside the blood vessel. &ldquo;Once an aneurysm bleeds, it changes the whole treatment picture.&rdquo;</p><p>According to stroke.org, once an aneurysm bleeds, the chance of death is about 40 percent and the chance of some brain damage is 66 percent, even if the aneurysm is treated. &ldquo;Four out of 10 people don&rsquo;t survive,&rdquo; added Dr. Hanel, &ldquo;and only two out of 10 return to a normal life.&rdquo;</p><p>In Burch&rsquo;s case, it wasn&rsquo;t the size of the aneurysm that concerned Dr. Hanel the most it was the weakness of the blood vessel. Plus, a second aneurysm, known as a daughter sac, had formed on the same artery, increasing the risk of rupture.</p><p>Last December, Dr. Hanel performed a minimally invasive procedure known as stent-assisted endovascular coiling to surgically treat Burch&rsquo;s aneurysms. During endovascular coiling, a catheter is passed through the groin and up into the artery containing the aneurysm. Tiny platinum coils shaped like springs are then released to induce clotting and seal off the aneurysm.</p><p>Burch was discharged from the hospital after a few days with no further neurological symptoms. Five months later, she and her husband and their two adult children toured Europe as planned.</p><p>&ldquo;We went to London, Italy and Copenhagen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I did something like 20,000 steps per day, according to my smart watch.&rdquo;</p><p>A non-smoker who has never taken blood pressure medication, Burch doesn&rsquo;t fall into the category of people at high risk of developing aneurysms.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a family history and there&rsquo;s nothing in my lifestyle that makes me a candidate for it,&rdquo; said the part-time diabetes educator and diet counselor who spent 25 years in clinical research.</p><p>&ldquo;The only thing I take is a baby aspirin.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Mothers have a sixth sense when there is something wrong with their baby and they will go far away if that&rsquo;s what it takes to give their child the best care. That&rsquo;s why Amanda Brewer, a retired army service member who lives in Savannah, Ga., brought her infant son, Mavrick, to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville.</p><p>&ldquo;It was hard, but I would do it all over again,&rdquo; said Brewer, a mother of four who traveled about 300 miles daily for nearly a month between her home and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, where Mavrick was receiving life-saving treatment for bacterial meningitis.</p><p>Mavrick was born nine weeks early at a Georgia hospital near Hunter Army Airfield, where Amanda&rsquo;s husband, Chris, is stationed. Mavrick weighed only three pounds, seven ounces, at birth.</p><p>From the beginning, Mavrick had difficulty eating, so local doctors recommended placing a gastrostomy feeding tube (G-tube) for the infant. Amanda says that at just a week old, Mavrick was diagnosed with MRSA, one of many strains of a bacterium called Staphylococcus aureus, and bacterial endocarditis, an infection of the heart. Mavrick&rsquo;s treatment included antibiotics for six weeks before he was able to go home.</p><p>Mavrick&rsquo;s health problems lingered and he was seen at multiple hospitals in Georgia. He had trouble breathing and eating, and was frequently pulling his G-tube out. Within two weeks, Mavrick was diagnosed with a coronavirus, a severe upper respiratory infection.</p><p>&ldquo;We were in and out of the hospital all the time,&rdquo; Brewer said. &ldquo;When you have a baby with a G-tube, it can be hard.&rdquo;</p><p>Brewer joined an online support group for G-tube feeding parents, where families in similar situations shared their experiences and resources. Through the support group, Brewer learned about <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a> in Jacksonville, Florida, and its nationally recognized pediatric care.</p><p>Mavrick&rsquo;s health challenges persisted. In addition to not eating, Mavrick became irritable and lethargic. Doctors ordered several tests including a CT scan and MRI, which showed swelling and fluid around his brain. Mavrick was diagnosed with life-threatening bacterial meningitis, an inflammation of the lining that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew right then I wanted Mavrick transferred to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Brewer said. &ldquo;Chris was deployed at the time but the military sent him home, and we arranged for a babysitter and after-school care for our other children, ages 2-8.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Once the transfer was arranged, Brewer followed the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Kids Kare mobile ICU carrying Mavrick to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. Brewer made the more than two-hour drive from Savannah daily while Mavrick was receiving treatment.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital was so supportive,&rdquo; Brewer said. &ldquo;They knew I was driving two-and-a-half hours each way and that I would have to leave in the afternoon to pick up my other kids. Everyone would reassure me that Mavrick would be cared for while I was gone.&rdquo;</p><p>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s medical team recommended antibiotics therapy for Mavrick and a specialized catheter IV that would deliver medications, nutrients and fluids so he could begin to heal and thrive.</p><p>&ldquo;The medical team at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s is amazing,&rdquo; Brewer said. &ldquo;The doctors listened to my concerns and answered all of my questions. Everyone on their team is so sweet and they treat you like family.&rdquo;</p><p>After 20 days at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, Mavrick completed his antibiotic therapy for meningitis and was released to go home.</p><p>&ldquo;In spite of all he has been through, Mavrick is a happy baby and always smiling,&rdquo; Brewer said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s small but he is built tough. You would never know that he has been through so much.&rdquo;</p><p>Mavrick continues to receive follow-up care with his Savannah-area pediatrician.</p><p>&ldquo;I am very happy we came to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital,&rdquo; Brewer said. &ldquo;I know I made the best decision. They gave my baby the best care.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville offers comprehensive, high-level for children with life-threatening and urgent medical needs. Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital cares for children from North Florida, South Georgia and beyond, providing services in partnership with Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, and the University of Florida College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville, Emergency Resources Group, and many community partners.

However, when social pressures and puberty occurs, many young women start to struggle with confidence.</p><p>&ldquo;There are steps we can take as parents to encourage daughters to be confident and strong,&rdquo; said Pinner.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1572028027/Juice/girl_power.jpg\" alt=\"Boost_Confidence_Daughter\"></div><p><strong>1. Allow failure as a tool for growth.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&ldquo;When she does fail, help her know she is resilient enough to get through tough situations,&rdquo; said Pinner. &ldquo;Say to her, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re strong. Let&rsquo;s figure this out together.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Parents can always point back to this in the future. &ldquo;Remind her of a time she overcame a difficult situation in the past,&rdquo; said Pinner. &ldquo;Through adversity comes strength.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>2. Compliment her positive actions.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you notice a positive or kind action, tell her! Pinner reminds us that these can be small moments throughout the day. For example, say &ldquo;I like the way you just spoke to your brother&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thank you for cleaning your room. Great attention to detail!&rdquo;</p><p><strong>3. Be a confident role model.</strong></p><p>Young people are highly influenced by people they spend time with, especially a parent. Moms, if you want to raise a confident daughter, be kind to yourself and eliminate the negative talk.</p><p>&ldquo;For example, if you forget something at the grocery store, it&rsquo;s so easy to say, &lsquo;Wow, I&rsquo;m so dumb. I can&rsquo;t believe I forgot that,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Pinner. &ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t want your daughter to talk to herself that way.&rdquo;</p><p>This relates to body image, too. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t tell your daughter she&rsquo;s ugly or overweight, so don&rsquo;t say it to yourself,&rdquo; said Pinner. &ldquo;She will talk to herself the way you talk to yourself.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>4.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>There are certain restaurants with a reputation for drawing in a desirable demographic: the young professionals ranging in age from about 22 to 35. What do most of these hot spots have in common? Irresistible food, Instagram-worthy d&eacute;cor and many times, a gluten-free or vegan menu.</p><p>&ldquo;In my professional experience, I have noticed an increase in food allergies over the years,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-michael-young-md\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Young, MD</a>, a family physician with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a>, said. &ldquo;The CDC backs my experience up, stating that food allergies increased by 50% from 1997 to 2011.&rdquo;</p><p>While the exact cause of the increase in food allergies is unclear, Dr. Young offered several hypotheses.</p><ul><li>The medical community has become more efficient at diagnosing food allergies, leading to higher numbers of diagnoses.</li><li>Lack of exposure to infectious organisms in childhood may create a scenario in which the immune system mistakes a food protein as an invading organism.</li><li>Overuse of antibiotics can cause changes to the microbiome, which is partially responsible for the immune system. The microbiome plays a part in epigenetics &ndash; the influence of internal and external factors that change a person&rsquo;s genes. While the exact cause of allergies is unknown, Dr. Young says medical professionals know genes and the environment play a role.</li><li>Exposure to chemicals and certain food in utero may cause allergies.</li></ul><p>Dr. Young said 90% of food allergies come from 8 foods:</p><ol><li>Milk</li><li>Eggs</li><li>Peanuts</li><li>Tree nuts</li><li>Soy</li><li>Wheat</li><li>Fish</li><li>Shellfish</li></ol><p>&ldquo;There is a belief now that over-avoidance of foods may lead to food allergies,&rdquo; Dr. Young said. &ldquo;Current research shows the early introduction of common food allergens may prevent allergies. For example, there are guidelines supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics to introduce peanuts to the highest-risk infants as early as 4 to 6 months of age.&rdquo;</p><p>According to a study published in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association Network Open</em>, an estimated 10.8% of adults in the United States have been diagnosed with at least one food allergy, while 19% of U.S. adults <em>believe&nbsp;</em>they have a food allergy.</p><p>&ldquo;People who voluntarily cut foods from their diet may be missing key nutrients and vitamins,&rdquo; Dr. Young said. &ldquo;It is easy to find those nutrients in other foods, but it is important to discuss it with your doctor.&rdquo;</p><p>Just because a person doesn&rsquo;t have a food allergy, however, doesn&rsquo;t mean he or she doesn&rsquo;t have a food intolerance. According to Dr. Young, food intolerance is more of a digestive issue than a true allergy.</p><p>Some popular diets and alternative ways to get necessary nutrients are:</p><ul><li><strong>Gluten-free:</strong> Gluten-free processed foods are typically lower in fiber and have a higher glycemic index, meaning they cause a rapid rise in blood sugar, according to Dr. Young. Additionally, foods with gluten, such as breads and cereals, are typically fortified with multiple vitamins. Pseudo-grains like quinoa or amaranth, an ancient grain originally grown and harvested by the Aztecs, are good sources of fiber for a gluten-free diet.</li><li><strong>Dairy-free:</strong> A dairy-free diet can lead to deficiencies in protein, calcium, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/primary-care/whats-the-big-d\" target=\"_blank\">vitamin D</a>, zinc and phosphorous. Protein can be made up through the consumption of meat, fish, legumes and protein powders. Calcium can be found in leafy green vegetables, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, and black beans. Both mushrooms and seafood such as cod, shrimp, sardines and salmon are good sources of vitamin D. Zinc and phosphorous can be found in multiple types of meat, lentils, chickpeas, nuts, pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds.</li><li><strong>Vegan:&nbsp;</strong>A vegan diet can lead to deficiencies in <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/primary-care/the-adult-abcs\" target=\"_blank\">vitamin B12</a>, vitamin D, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids and iron. Deficiencies in vitamin D and zinc can be addressed in the same ways as for a dairy-free diet. Vitamin B12 can be consumed through nutritional yeast, plant milks and supplements. Iron can be found in lentils, soybeans and tofu. To make up omega-3 fatty acids, a person could turn to chia seeds, flax seeds, hemp seeds and walnuts.</li></ul><p>Dr. Young recommends always talking to your primary care doctor before starting any new diet plan to ensure it&rsquo;s right for you.</p><p><em>If you suspect you have a food allergy or intolerance, reach out to your&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\"><em>primary care</em></a><em>&nbsp;physician for guidance.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Hepatitis A cases are growing in our state and the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) has declared the epidemic a &ldquo;health emergency.&rdquo; Since Jan. 1, 2019, there have been more than 2,904 cases of this serious liver infection reported in the state, more than five times the number of cases reported in 2018. The FDOH said that 80% of those with hepatitis A have been hospitalized, and there have been more than 30 deaths in Florida alone.</p><p>The three counties with the highest volume of cases (Jan. 1, 2019-Oct. 5, 2019) are Pasco (397), Pinellas (369) and nearby Volusia, which has already had 244 reported cases this year. The outbreak is so serious that county health departments (CHDs) across the state are offering free hepatitis A vaccinations to high-risk groups in the state.</p><p><strong>What is hepatitis A?</strong></p><p>Hepatitis is a highly contagious viral liver infection that can cause mild to severe illness. While B and C are most often spread when the blood of an infected person enters the body of someone who is not infected, hepatitis A is spread when a person ingests fecal matter, even in microscopic amounts.</p><p>Many people associate hepatitis A with people who use drugs, those who are experiencing homelessness and men who have sex with men. However, <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-infectious-disease-specialist/dr-mobeen-rathore-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mobeen Rathore, MD</a>, chief of pediatric infectious disease and immunology for Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, said there are other ways people can get the infection and everyone&rsquo;s at risk, including children.</p><p>&ldquo;We believe the hepatitis A outbreak we&rsquo;re seeing in Florida and around the country may be due, in part, to unwashed fruits and vegetables,&rdquo; he said. Shellfish, ice, and water also are common sources of the disease.</p><p><strong>Who should get the vaccine?</strong></p><p>According to Dr. Rathore, hepatitis A is often much more severe in adults than in children. &ldquo;However, the hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for all children at one year of age so that they don&rsquo;t get the infection later in life and become more seriously ill with conditions such as serious liver disease,&rdquo; he added. &nbsp;&ldquo;This vaccine also protects against outbreaks like the one we are experiencing in Florida. Because of the hygiene habits of children, this virus could potentially spread quickly through schools and daycare centers.&rdquo;</p><p>Children should get their first dose of the hepatitis A vaccine, along with other CDC-recommended immunizations such as MMR (which protects against measles, mumps and rubella) and varicella (which protects against the virus that causes chickenpox), at 12 months of age. The second dose should be administered 6-18 months after the first.</p><p>Dr. Rathore said adults should talk to their health care provider about whether they are a high risk for hepatitis A or B and if they need the vaccine. &ldquo;If you are immunocompromised or have liver disease of any kind, you should be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B to prevent severe liver damage,&rdquo; he recommended. &ldquo;And always practice good hand hygiene, especially after using the bathroom, changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food.&quot;</p><p><em>Sources: <a href=\"http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vaccine-preventable-disease/hepatitis-a/index.html'\" target=\"_blank\">Florida Department of Health</a></em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>CDC Recommended Immunization Schedule, Birth to 15 Months</em></a></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>It seems like a simple thing. Soothe your crying toddler by handing her a cell phone, and she&rsquo;ll be occupied for hours. But too much screen time is not good for very young children, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatrician/dr-jennifer-knight-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jill Knight, MD</a>, a pediatrician with Baptist Primary Care. That includes cell phones, iPads and TV.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s convenient, it keeps the child hypnotized,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But young children who are using screens all the time have more trouble regulating their emotions. If you try to take their cell phone away, they have a meltdown.&rdquo;</p><p>Most parents realize it&rsquo;s not a great idea to use a cell phone as a virtual babysitter, Dr. Knight said. Moms are often contrite when toddlers show off just how tethered they are to their phones. But getting kids away from screens is more than just a personal preference.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier this year came out with its first guidelines on how much screen time is OK for children under five. The limit for 2- to 4-year-olds is 1 hour per day, and less is better. Children under 2 years of age shouldn&rsquo;t have any screen time at all, the organization said.</p><p>That&rsquo;s a distant cry from what&rsquo;s happening.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Kids start using the cell phone as early as they can hold the phone, and they are less than 1 year of age,&rdquo; Dr. Knight said. &ldquo;We find, by age 5, if we ask a child their phone number, what they actually know is the code that unlocks the phone.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Risks of too much screen time</strong></p><p>WHO developed play, sleep and screen guidelines at the urging of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity and the Global Action Plan on Physical Activity. Too much screen time contributes to obesity, Dr. Knight said, because it means kids are less active. But excess screen time can cause a range of other problems as well.</p><p>Because screens are very stimulating, if they&rsquo;re used right before bed or nap time, it makes it hard for a child to unwind and get good quality sleep, Dr. Knight said. Children with too much screen time exhibit poorer social skills and delayed fine and gross motor development.</p><p>Research also shows an extreme amount of screen time can cause autism-type symptoms in very young children. Dr. Knight said she sees children who are so engaged with a phone, they don&rsquo;t make eye contact and they can&rsquo;t speak using two- and three-word phrases.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost impossible to measure developmental markers because there are none. The screen is the world they interact with,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s scary to see how addicted they are to the phone. That little brain is so plastic.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;For children to develop normally, parents need to engage with them, Dr. Knight said.</p><p>WHO says young children need physical activities of varying intensity spread throughout the day. Infants who are not yet mobile need a total of 30 minutes of &ldquo;tummy time&rdquo; (prone on the floor) throughout the day. When young children are sedentary, reading or storytelling from a caregiver and better than screen time.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have questions about ways to promote your child&rsquo;s development, contact your &nbsp;pediatrician. Or, visit Baptist Primary Care to find a doctor near you.</p><p><strong>WHO Guidelines on Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior and Sleep for Children Under 5 Years of Age&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>For infants (younger than 1 year):</strong></p><ul><li>No screen time at all</li><li>A variety of physical activities several times a day, as often as possible while interacting with a caregiver. Before babies can crawl or walk, they need &ldquo;tummy time&rdquo; prone on the floor.</li><li>No more than 1 hour a day restrained in a high chair, stroller, or worn on a caregiver&rsquo;s back</li><li>Sleep including naps totaling 14 to 17 hours until 3 months old; 12 to 16 hours from 4 to 11 months old.</li></ul><p><strong>For toddlers (1 to 2 years old):</strong></p><ul><li>No sedentary screen time for 1-year-olds, an hour or less of screen time for two-year-olds</li><li>At least 180 minutes of various physical activities, spread throughout the day</li><li>No more than 1 hour a day restrained in a high chair, stroller or baby carrier</li><li>Sleep, including naps, totaling 11 to 14 hours, with regular bedtimes and wakeup times</li></ul><p><strong>For preschoolers (3 to 4 years old):</strong></p><ul><li>An hour or less of sedentary screen time</li><li>At least 180 minutes of various physical activities, spread throughout the day, with at least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise</li><li>No more than 1 hour a day restrained in a high chair, stroller or baby carrier</li><li>Sleep including naps totaling 10 to 13 hours, with regular bedtimes and wakeup times</li></ul>",

From lunchboxes to textbooks, there&rsquo;s plenty your kid needs to succeed. But can they shoulder it all?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-orthopedic-surgeon/dr-kevin-neal-md\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Neal, MD</a>, chief of Pediatric Orthopedic Surgery at Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital and Pediatric Orthopedic Fellowship director at Nemours Children&#39;s Specialty Care, recommends weighing your child&rsquo;s backpack to be sure it&rsquo;s not too heavy for them. This is especially important as the school year wears on and students are in the thick of schoolwork, sports, and other after-school activities which may fill up their bags with gear.</p><p>&ldquo;To measure the weight of a backpack, the best way is to have a child stand on the scale with the backpack, then without the backpack, and subtract the difference,&rdquo; Dr. Neal explained. &ldquo;The general recommendation, which comes from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), is that the upper limit should be about 10% of body weight. So, for a 100-pound child that&rsquo;s about 10 pounds.&rdquo;</p><p>A too-heavy backpack can cause problems over time according to Dr. Neal. All people become susceptible to back pain as they age, and carrying around heavy loads only worsens the issue. Doing so multiple times a day throughout an entire school year? That&rsquo;s bound to add up.</p><p>&ldquo;Back pain becomes very common in all humans starting around middle school after children go through puberty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;50% of teenagers experience back pain, and so do 90% of adults. Heavy backpacks can make things worse.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Neal added that choosing the right backpack style can also help prevent back pain in students of any age. Rolling backpacks seem like an obvious solution, but he said many schools won&rsquo;t allow them because they can cause tripping accidents. Instead, focus on finding the best fit.</p><p>&ldquo;Look for backpacks with two wide, well-padded straps and a waist strap to help distribute the bag&rsquo;s weight more evenly across the body. Placing heavier items, like laptops or textbooks, closer to the back is ideal, so choose a bag with compartments that allow for easy partitioning,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>While causes of significant back pain or spinal degeneration are rare in children, Dr. Neal wants parents to seek a professional opinion if concerned.</p><p>&ldquo;If a child has an unusual amount of back pain, I would highly encourage them to see a physician to ensure there&rsquo;s nothing serious going on,&rdquo; he said.</p><p><em>If your child is experiencing back pain, whether from a heavy backpack or something unknown, call Nemours Children&#39;s Specialty Care at&nbsp;</em><a href=\"tel:1-904-697-3600\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.697.3600</em></a><em>&nbsp;to schedule an evaluation with a pediatric orthopedic specialist.&nbsp;</em></p>",

Being able to diagnose something like that really interested me and solidified my yearning to become a doctor.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Former personal trainer</strong></p><p>Before attending medical school, Dr. Pena earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University and a master&rsquo;s in public health from the University of Georgia.</p><p>He also took a gap year to work as a personal trainer in the Atlanta area.</p><p>&ldquo;I got interested in personal training because I was pretty overweight in college,&rdquo; said Dr. Pena, who lost about 70 pounds after graduate school.</p><p>&ldquo;When I got to medical school, I trained a few clients on the side to make extra money and to stay in shape. To be a successful personal trainer, you have to be fit or no one will listen to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Pena had a bout of exercise-induced asthma as a child but went on to play varsity tennis in high school and participate in the marching band.</p><p><strong>Son of immigrants</strong></p><p>After a residency in internal medicine and a fellowship in cardiology, both at Banner University Medical Center in Phoenix, Ariz., Dr. Pena joined Baptist Heart Specialists in August 2019, specializing in diagnostic cardiac testing and exercise training.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very interested in preventative cardiology, screenings and managing patients before their coronary disease or hypertension becomes more advanced,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Patients who understand their pathology are more likely to take their medications, check their blood pressure and accept most medical interventions.&rdquo;</p><p>The son of immigrants, Dr. Pena is the first person in his family to graduate from college. His mother, a travel agent in Suwanee, Ga., and a bilingual parent specialist with the Georgia Department of Education was born in Baja, Calif. His father, Alejandro Sr., a Major League Baseball pitcher from 1981 to 1996, and the recipient of two World Series rings was born in the Dominican Republic.</p><p>&ldquo;My dad was only 18 when he signed a free-agent contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1981,&rdquo; said Dr. Pena, who was born in 1984, the year his father won a dozen games as a starting pitcher for the Dodgers and led the league in earned-run average.</p><p>&ldquo;Neither of my parents knew the language when they came to this country to provide a better life for me and my sister.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>While a pet can provide great fun, love and companionship, older adults, in particular, have much to gain from caring for a furry friend.</p><p><strong>Companionship</strong><br>There is nothing like the feeling of coming home to a pet, wagging its tail in excitement, waiting for you by the door or its warm fur as it lies next to you in bed. Companionship is one of the many benefits of owning a pet as they provide love, comfort and protection.</p><p>&ldquo;I have had many patients who find pets to be fantastic companions that help them emotionally and sometimes are the main constant in their lives,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/geriatrician/dr-courtney-ross-md\">Courtney Ross, MD,</a> a geriatrician at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/geriatric-care\">Baptist AgeWell,</a> a primary care program for adults over 65.</p><p><strong>Psychological benefits</strong><br>Pets also come with many hidden health benefits. According to a Harvard study, dogs have been proven to decrease the risk of heart disease and blood pressure, especially in older adults. Interacting with animals, like dogs and cats, has been shown to increase levels of the &ldquo;feel-good&rdquo; hormone serotonin while decreasing levels of cortisol, a stress-related hormone. This allows the pet owner to be calm and more mindful.</p><p>&ldquo;I recently had a patient tell me that despite her medical problems, her dog was part of her &lsquo;therapy,&rsquo; and she didn&rsquo;t know how she&rsquo;d cope without him,&rdquo; said Dr. Ross. &ldquo;I think others would say the same.&rdquo;</p><p>Research proves that pet owners feel less isolated and more social than non-owners.</p><p><strong>Physical benefits</strong><br>A recent study found that pet owners, specifically those who own dogs, spend about 200 more minutes a week of walking than people without dogs. Due to the responsibility of having to interact and make sure your pup gets the right amount of exercise, sometimes requiring that you walk them, it is easier for pet owners to get in more daily steps compared to someone without.</p><p><strong>Caution and care</strong><br>While pets can contribute a wide range of health benefits to an older adult, they aren&rsquo;t for everyone as they require a lot of care. Dr. Ross suggests that before an older adult takes on the responsibility of a furry friend, be sure that he or she has the ability to adequately care for it physically, economically and emotionally. And as most pet owners would say, pets are like a members of the family, so remember to show them plenty of love and affection.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Jayda\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1571158716/Juice/IMG_0471.jpg\"><em>Written by Jayda Rhodes, Ribault High School senior and sophomore at Florida State College of Jacksonville.</em></div><p><em>AgeWell is a unique kind of primary care that helps adults 65 and over get ahead of common aging issues.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>This year we&rsquo;re chanting &ldquo;FLUUUVAL,&rdquo; not to be confused with &ldquo;DUUUVAL,&rdquo; the official battle cry of Jacksonville Jaguars football fans. It&rsquo;s time for a winning season&hellip;flu season that is. Avoid the flu this year by knowing your flu shot facts and getting vaccinated.</p><p><strong>MYTH #1: &ldquo;The flu shot can give me the flu.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s time for this flu shot myth to be tackled! According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), flu vaccines cannot cause flu illness. The vaccine is made with either &ldquo;inactivated&rdquo; flu viruses that are not infectious or by using only a single gene from a flu virus, which causes an immune response without causing infection.</p><p><strong>MYTH #2: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get the flu shot because I&rsquo;m pregnant.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>When vaccinated during pregnancy, mothers pass antibodies to the developing baby. There are many studies that show flu shots protect mom and her newest little teammate for several months after birth, when baby isn&rsquo;t old enough to be vaccinated.</p><p>&ldquo;Influenza infection can be devastating during pregnancy for both the mother and baby,&rdquo; explained Mobeen Rathore, MD, chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease and Immunology for Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. &ldquo;Pregnant mothers can get a particularly severe disease if infected during pregnancy. For the baby, it can result in stillbirth or miscarriage.&rdquo;</p><p>The CDC recommends that everyone over 6 months of age get the flu vaccine every season. Different flu vaccines &nbsp;are approved for use in different groups of people. If you have questions about which vaccine is best for you or your family members, talk to your primary care physician.</p><p><strong>MYTH #3: &ldquo;The flu isn&rsquo;t serious. I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>We&rsquo;re calling a timeout!</p><p>&ldquo;Anyone is at risk for influenza infection, healthy or sick, old or young,&rdquo; said Dr. Rathore. &ldquo;People with underlying health conditions, young people or elderly people, can get a particularly serious disease and they are at higher risk of dying from the disease.&rdquo;</p><p>A recent study in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases (CID) showed that flu vaccination reduced deaths, intensive care unit length of stay and overall duration of hospitalization among flu patients.</p><p>&ldquo;When you get the influenza vaccine, you&rsquo;re not only protecting yourself, you are protecting the people around you,&rdquo; said Dr. Rathore. &ldquo;The influenza vaccine is recommended for all ages starting at 6 months of age. Like all vaccines, there are some people who cannot have it or people with underlying health conditions may not respond to the vaccine. To protect those under six months of age, those who cannot get the influenza vaccine and those who may not respond to the vaccine, it is important for others around them to be vaccinated. This is referred to as &lsquo;cocooning.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Getting the flu shot isn&rsquo;t just about protecting yourself; it&rsquo;s about defending your community as well.</p><p><strong>MYTH #4: &ldquo;The flu shot doesn&rsquo;t work because people who get the flu shot can still get the flu.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Flu viruses change constantly and the flu vaccine may be updated from one season to the next as well. That&rsquo;s why yearly vaccination is needed for the best protection. Getting a flu shot has been shown to reduce risk of illness by an average of 40-60%.</p><p>The flu vaccine is the best protection against the flu &ndash; the first line of defense &ndash; but it&rsquo;s also important to practice other healthy habits:</p><ul><li>Avoid close contact to people who are sick.</li><li>Stay home from work or school for at least 24 hours after a fever has disappeared.</li><li>Regularly wash your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li><li>Maintain a strong immune system by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, sleeping well and reducing stress.</li><li>Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze.</li><li>Clean and disinfect surfaces that may have been exposed to the virus.</li></ul><p><strong>MYTH #5: &ldquo;Oops&hellip;it&rsquo;s too late for me to get the flu shot.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>While the CDC recommends people get the flu vaccine by the end of October, getting vaccinated later can also have benefits. Flu season peaks between December and February but activity can last as late as May. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body that protect against flu. Get vaccinated as soon as possible &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not too late!</p><p>Let&rsquo;s tackle the flu together this season by not forgetting to chant &ldquo;FLUUUVAL&rdquo; after our flu shots in &ldquo;DUUUVAL.&rdquo;</p><div style=\"position: relative; display: block; max-width: 100%;\"><div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/4709052668001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6087030628001\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div></div><p><em>To get your flu shot, make an appointment with a&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Primary Care&nbsp;</em></a><em>physician or visit a&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-health-clinic-at-walgreens\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Health Clinic at Walgreens</em></a><em>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>A Popsicle&reg; for breakfast. That&rsquo;s how my day started. Thoughts of the evening and the next day ahead were making me feel anxious, to say the least.</p><p>I had dreaded it, postponed it and plain-out feared it. Let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; the entire thing sounds gross. A colonoscopy, that is.</p><p>The first time I made the appointment, I chickened out. Working for a health system, I know how important health screenings are. Heck, I write about them all the time. Colonoscopies are the most effective way to detect colon cancer early, when it&rsquo;s most curable. During the procedure, suspicious polyps can easily be removed. It is recommended to have a colonoscopy at age 50 and then every 10 years after that (age 40 if you have a family history of colorectal cancer or colon polyps).</p><p>So, big girl pants on, I finally rebooked my appointment.</p><p>The day before my procedure, I could have clear liquids only. Hence, the Popsicle for breakfast. Jell-O&reg; and 7Up&reg; were lunch and dinner was the same.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the prep. It&rsquo;s the worst part, as they say, but it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as I thought. At 3 pm, I had to take two laxatives. I was a bit concerned about being at work during this time. So I went home early. (Pretty good excuse, I figured.)</p><p>I made it successfully home and hunkered down for the storm &ndash; the &ldquo;s---&quot; storm that is. During the course of the evening, I had to drink 64 ounces of clear liquid mixed with a powder laxative. (Tip: I used Citrus Cooler Gatorade&reg;, which made it taste sort of good.)</p><p>Fortunately, everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, came out. Sleeping was a bit of a challenge, though, as I got up five times for more bathroom fun.</p><p>When I woke the next day, I actually felt fine. My husband and I headed to <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-south\">Baptist Medical Center South&nbsp;</a>for the 8:30 a.m. procedure, and he stayed in the waiting room so he could drive me home afterward. In the pre-op room, the nurse, who was amazingly comforting, gently rubbed my arm as another nurse inserted the IV. It stung for a few seconds.</p><p>Then it was show time. I was wheeled into the operating room and <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/gastroenterologist/dr-daniel-kohm-md\">Daniel Kohm, MD,</a> a gastroenterologist with Borland Groover Clinic who works at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-south\">Baptist Medical Center South,</a> explained the procedure to me and emphasized that I would be comfortable and wouldn&rsquo;t feel a thing.</p><p>That was hard to imagine because I had done my research. During a colonoscopy, the doctor uses a long, flexible tube about a half-inch in diameter that allows him or her to see possible abnormalities in the lining of the colon. The colonoscope is inserted through the rectum and advanced to the other end of the large intestine. That just didn&rsquo;t sound good to me!</p><p>The anesthesiologist came in and began the IV drip to put me in twilight sleep. We talked about work and tennis and the next thing I knew, I was waking up in the recovery room. It was over! I had survived and I felt relieved. I learned that I had a small polyp that was easily removed during the procedure. They sent it off to pathology and suspected it was benign.</p><p>After about 30 minutes in recovery, I was discharged and other than feeling hungry, I felt fairly normal. My husband took me to our favorite little diner and I ate like a champ. I was a little groggy afterward and had a glorious bonus day snoozing on the couch.</p><p>About a week later, I got a letter verifying the polyp was in fact benign.

That means it&rsquo;s time to meet up with friends, maybe have a few drinks, and of course, suffer through the Jacksonville heat. During the summer months and early fall, because we all know it stays hot in Jacksonville well past summer, I treat someone in the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/emergency-medical-specialist/dr-matthew-thompson-md\" target=\"_blank\">emergency room</a> for a heat-related illness on just about every shift. &nbsp;Most of those people were enjoying the day on a boat, at the beach or at a sporting event.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1569935618/JFRD_termometer_pic_n0pd18.jpg\" alt=\"JRFDthermometer\"></div><p>During the Jaguars&rsquo; home opener against the Kansas City Chiefs on September 8, temperatures soared to well over 100 degrees. According to the Jacksonville Fire Rescue Department, there were 86 medical calls inside the stadium and 18 people had to be taken to the hospital.</p><p>A visit to the emergency room will always ruin a football Sunday, so if you&rsquo;re planning on going to a Jags game, an outdoor concert or any other event when it&rsquo;s hot, this article is for you.</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s the harm in a little heat?</strong></p><p>Prolonged exposure to the heat or the sun will lead to heat exhaustion and eventually heat stroke. &nbsp;After your core body temperature has been elevated for enough time, you may notice a headache, nausea/vomiting, weakness or fatigue. &nbsp;Overall, you just feel worn out and maybe a little lightheaded.</p><p>Many of us have experienced heat exhaustion, and the early signs can often be overlooked. If you don&rsquo;t listen to your body, it could lead to dehydration, which eventually causes your kidneys to fail and your muscles to break down. &nbsp;No one wants muscle breakdown and organ failure at a football game! So, when these symptoms kick in, get out of the heat, cool down and hydrate!</p><p>Most people will take precautions once they feel the signs of heat exhaustion, but if you don&rsquo;t, heat exhaustion could escalate to heat stroke.</p><p>Heat stroke usually occurs when your body temperature rises above 104 degrees for a prolonged period of time. However, certain things can increase your risk of heat stroke. Medications, drugs, alcohol, obesity, extreme ages (young and old) and heart disease are all going to increase your chances of having a deadly encounter with heat.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1569935619/thompson_head_shot_qagnxb.jpg\" alt=\"Thompson\"></div><p>Heat stroke is characterized by all of the nasty symptoms associated with heat exhaustion, plus altered mental status, confusion, memory loss, hallucinations and even seizures. During heat stroke, your body stops sweating and your organs shut down. &nbsp;You may even stop breathing safely on your own. &nbsp;This is most definitely a medical emergency and you should be seeing me or one of my colleagues in the ER. If I haven&rsquo;t scared you yet, you&rsquo;ve had too many drinks! Speaking of which&hellip;</p><p><strong>Blame it on the a-a-a-a-alcohol!</strong></p><p>There will always be people who choose alcohol over ice water. What harm could another mixed drink, wine, beer or champagne (on victory days, of course) do? Alcohol is a diuretic, a substance that increases your urine output. It will cause your kidneys to get rid of more water than normal, which causes you to be even more dehydrated than before.</p><p><strong>Do you have some tips for the heat?</strong></p><p>I thought you&rsquo;d never ask!</p><ol><li><strong>Drink more water.</strong> Healthy adults should be drinking about eight glasses of water a day. In the heat, you&rsquo;ll need much more. Remember, alcohol pulls water out of your body and even if you are urinating frequently and it&rsquo;s clear, you could still be dehydrated. If you are drinking alcohol while out in the sun, drink a large glass of water with every alcoholic beverage you have.</li><li><strong>Wear sunscreen and protective clothing.&nbsp;</strong>Let me tell you a little about myself: I&rsquo;m pale. In fact, I look like a long-haired, Scandinavian hippy doctor. After a few hours in the sun, my skin is red. A simple sunburn is actually a first-degree burn, and one of the main complications of burns is dehydration. So, wear sunscreen or breathable, UV-protective clothing. &nbsp;Even those with darker complexions need to be wary of direct exposure to the sun, which will contribute to heat-related illnesses. Listen to what your body tells you and enjoy some shade.</li><li><strong>Light beer is not a water replacement, but it&rsquo;s the best option for alcohol.&nbsp;</strong>I love a good IPA or even a margarita if I&rsquo;m feeling fancy, but when you&rsquo;re outside for long periods of time, it&rsquo;s best to stick with light beer with lower alcohol content and higher water. It does NOT replace water, but will do less damage after several hours.</li><li><strong>Have a buddy system.</strong> Keep an eye on your friends and family. If someone has a headache or is getting tired and sits down, get them to a cooler location and give them a glass of water. &nbsp;It may save their whole afternoon, or even their life.</li><li><strong>Take care of those at higher risk.&nbsp;</strong>Your kids and grandparents are much more susceptible to the heat. If you have any medical conditions, make sure you have an exit strategy if you get too hot or tired.</li></ol><p>Have fun out there! We may have hurricanes and crazy heat, but we live in the best city, so enjoy it!</p><div class=\"u-size4of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1569935613/jags_game_heat_infographic_d2o1j3.jpg\" alt=\"readytoroarinfographic\"></div><p><em>Our guest columnist is&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/emergency-medical-specialist/dr-matthew-thompson-md\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Matthew Thompson, MD</em></a><em>, an emergency medicine physician with Baptist Health and Emergency Resources Group.

Spiritual:&nbsp;</strong>Identifying your &ldquo;why&rdquo; can expand your sense of purpose and is a very personal part of your wellness journey.

Financial:&nbsp;</strong>Financial wellness varies from person- to- person but it&rsquo;s all about managing your resources, making informed spending decisions and setting realistic goals.

Vocational wellness is centered on participating in work that provides personal satisfaction. To feel well in this area, develop a career path that provides meaning to you.</p><p><strong>8.

Today, it affects about 16 million people.</p><p>The condition is most commonly seen in people of Scandinavian descent and is often referred to by the colloquial term, Viking&rsquo;s disease.</p><div class=\"u-size1of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1569013059/Juice/jennifer-madden-md-8x10_2.jpg\" alt=\"MaddenMD\"></div><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty common to see this condition in my practice,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/orthopedic-surgeon/dr-jennifer-madden-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Madden</a>, MD, an orthopaedic surgeon with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/jacksonville-orthopaedic-institute\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</a> (JOI). &ldquo;I see people every week who don&rsquo;t realize they have it and learn about Dupuytren&rsquo;s for the first time.&rdquo;</p><p>Dupuytren&rsquo;s contracture first appears as a tender lump of tissue under the palm. As more lumps form, they resemble a rope-like cord of tissue, which over time prevents fingers &ndash; usually the ring and pinky &ndash; from straightening. This hand deformity is most common among people over the age of 50 and men are more likely to be affected than women.</p><p>Left untreated, Viking&rsquo;s disease worsens over time. Besides Elway, other well-known people with the hand condition include former President Ronald Reagan and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p><p><strong>Couldn&rsquo;t grip a football</strong></p><p>When Elway, now 59, was diagnosed with the condition in 2005, the former Super Bowl MVP couldn&rsquo;t grip a football with either hand because both of his ring fingers were constricted. &ldquo;That really bothered me,&rdquo; he recently told FactsonHand.com, a national Dupuytren&rsquo;s contracture awareness campaign.</p><p>According to JOI, an affiliate of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health</a>, the condition can be treated surgically to restore finger motion, followed by occupational therapy, or non-surgically through enzyme injections to break up the tough tissue.</p><p>Another less-invasive treatment known as needle aponeurotomy divides and cuts the tissue and doesn&rsquo;t involve an incision. Both non-surgical treatments can be performed in an orthopedic surgeon&rsquo;s office. Following the procedure, the patient often has to use a hand contracture splint for a period of time as part of the rehabilitation process.</p><p>&ldquo;The enzyme injections became available to the general patient population about 10 years ago and they work better on some types of contracture than others,&rdquo; said Dr. Madden, who treats some of her patients with injections of the FDA-approved drug Xiaflex&reg;, a mixture of proteins derived from certain bacteria.</p><p>&ldquo;You can still have a recurrence of Dupuytren&rsquo;s, regardless of whether you have surgery or injections. The younger you are, the more likely you are to have a more progressive form and a significant chance of recurrence. I&rsquo;ve seen patients in their 30s with it.&rdquo;</p><p>After being treated non-surgically, Elway, now general manager and president of football operations for the Denver Broncos, said both of his hands have returned to a normal functioning state.</p><p>&ldquo;There are different types of treatment available. It&rsquo;s important to see a hand doctor and catch this early,&rdquo; he said during a guest appearance on NBC&rsquo;s <em>Today Show</em>. &ldquo;There is no cure but there is a fix.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you notice lumps or nodules on your palms or have any concerns about your hands, talk to your&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/primary-care\" target=\"_blank\"><em>primary care doctor&nbsp;</em></a><em>or call JOI at <a href=\"tel:1-904-564-2000\" target=\"_blank\">JOI-2000</a></em><em>.</em></p>",

As the founder of The Benjamin Ivory Foundation &mdash; a nonprofit organization that educates, advocates, and assists in optimizing the overall health of those living with sickle cell disease &mdash; he&rsquo;s active in the community, always working to connect patients and families to resources and support.</p><p>The cause is personal to DJ. He&rsquo;s lost loved ones to the disease and lives with it himself. He prefers to think of himself and others as a &ldquo;sickle cell warrior&rdquo; because the disease is a daily battle.</p><p>Thankfully, it&rsquo;s not one that he has to face alone.</p><p><strong>A lifelong battle&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sickle cell disease is named for the thin, crescent-shaped red blood cells that face more difficulty passing through blood vessels. It is passed down through families and primarily affects people of African and Mediterranean descent, though it is also common among people from South and Central America, the Caribbean and the Middle East. Approximately 1 in every 365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.</p><p>DJ was just 18 months old when he experienced his first sickle cell crisis, a common symptom of sickle cell disease that brings excruciating pain as sickled red blood cells block blood vessels throughout the body. He began treatment at <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital&nbsp;</a>and has since received care from <a href=\"http://www.baptistjax.com\">Baptist Health</a> doctors. His battle with sickle cell has taken an extreme toll on his health; he was diagnosed with avascular necrosis in his left hip in 2001, and end-stage renal failure in 2004.<br><br>Despite the challenges, he has found comfort in knowing his doctors have his health &mdash; and best interests &mdash; at heart.<br><br>&ldquo;My experience with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s and Baptist Health have always been positive,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whenever I am admitted, the doctors and nurses always make sure that care is up to standard and beyond. As a patient of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/nephrologist/dr-haritha-sakhamuri-md\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. [Haritha] Sakhamuri</a>, I&rsquo;ve seen her take command of my care while hospitalized to make sure I am comfortable, and that my health and stay is short, but effective.&rdquo;</p><p>For a long time, DJ was ashamed to share his experiences with others.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember when I was growing up, I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone that I had sickle cell. I wanted to appear as normal as possible,&rdquo; he recalls.</p><p>That mindset changed as he learned that the disease affected some of his family members and close friends. He came to view the disease as a catalyst to achieve goals and chase dreams.</p><p>While enduring dialysis treatment throughout high school and his initial college career, he kept working to achieve his academic goals. DJ received a kidney transplant in 2011 and was later accepted to Jacksonville University, where he completed his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in 2013.</p><p>&ldquo;There were so many times I would have a paper due or a test to prepare for and a crisis would send me to the hospital just days before. It took me about seven years to complete my bachelor&#39;s degree due to the setbacks and complications that come with sickle cell,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>In 2016, DJ lost a close friend to sickle cell disease. In honor of his friend, he started his foundation, which helps patients and their families deal with sickle cell disease through a much-needed support system and access to additional resources.&nbsp;</p><p>With dreams of completing law school, DJ has an end goal of becoming a legal advocate for sickle cell patients and veterans, or a judge in the health care sector.</p><p><strong>Supporting sickle cell warriors</strong></p><p>While there is no universal cure for sickle cell disease, blood transfusions can help sickle cell warriors manage the disease&rsquo;s symptoms. Transfusions can help increase the amount of healthy red blood cells in the bloodstream and lessen the effects of the sickle-shaped cells.</p><p>Blood donors are critical to the long-term treatment of patients living with sickle cell disease. The best transfusion matches are likely to be found within a patient&rsquo;s own ethnic group.

I always ask my patients about their sleep and usually, they giggle, as if sleep is a luxury that they simply cannot afford.</p><p>There are literally volumes of research on the importance of sleep and the physical, mental and emotional health risks &ndash; that are &ndash; associated with sleep deprivation.</p><p>Among them are:</p><ul><li>Heart disease</li><li>Heart attack and heart failure</li><li>Irregular heartbeat</li><li>High blood pressure</li><li>Stroke</li><li>Diabetes</li></ul><p>A 2007 British study said lack of sleep doubled the risk of death from a cardiovascular event. Many of these issues stem from the fact that lack of sleep increases hunger, which leads to the craving of high-fat, high-carbohydrate food. This can eventually lead to weight gain and obesity.</p><p>Besides the serious medical risks associated with lack of sleep, there are other potential mental health and emotional risks associated with chronic sleep loss, from general irritability to depression and anxiety. Lack of proper sleep is proven to alter our learning and problem-solving and can also impair our ability to make sound and reasonable judgments.</p><p>Many people have convinced themselves they only need six or fewer hours of sleep a night.</p><p>However, increased depression and anxiety are strongly associated with decreased sleep, according to a study by the National Sleep Foundation.</p><p>Insomnia can exacerbate depression and lead to increased irritability and over-reaction to everyday circumstances and situations.</p><p>We all need more sleep, but how do we get it?</p><p>Here are a few suggestions: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Decrease your caffeine intake.&nbsp;</strong>Stop caffeine consumption at approximately 2-3 pm.</li><li><strong>Eliminate long naps.&nbsp;</strong>A short, 20-minute catnap can recharge your batteries and won&rsquo;t confuse your internal clock, or circadian rhythm.</li><li><strong>Keep consistent sleep/wake times.</strong> Irregular sleep patterns can alter your circadian rhythm and melatonin level; signaling your brain to sleep.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>In early July, 20-year-old actor Cameron Boyce passed away at home in his sleep. The news shocked fans who grew to love him in his roles on Disney Channel&#39;s Jessie and Descendants, and HBO&rsquo;s Mrs. Fletcher. His family later confirmed Boyce&rsquo;s passing was caused by an epileptic seizure; he had lived with the condition for years.</p><p><strong>Is death due to epilepsy common?</strong></p><p>Parents of children and teens with epilepsy may feel shocked to see epilepsy and death connected in major headlines. <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-neurologist/dr-harry-abram-md\" target=\"_blank\">Harry Abram, MD</a>, a pediatric neurologist Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, and at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, cares for pediatric patients with epilepsy each day. He said he understands why parents and teens may be distressed following this news.</p><p>&ldquo;Epilepsy can be a very unsettling condition; it&rsquo;s not always well understood why children have seizures. The issue of death with epilepsy is well recognized,&rdquo; Dr. Abram explains. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very rare: in children, it&rsquo;s about 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 5,000 per year.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Abram said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about Cameron Boyce other than what has been in the news, but he appears to have been a healthy young man. I don&rsquo;t know the specifics of his epilepsy or how it was treated. Children who die of epilepsy usually have other severe neurologic problems, like a genetic disorder or cerebral palsy. For a healthy, well-appearing young person to die is certainly very rare.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>How can a seizure lead to death?</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s biologically difficult to determine why seizures sometimes cause the worst. However, waking up from or falling asleep is known to pose more risk for seizure sufferers.</p><p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re asleep, particularly falling asleep and waking up, the seizure threshold is lower so that is a common time to have a seizure,&rdquo; Dr. Abram said. &ldquo;In this case, it seems sudden, unexpected and unexplained. With epilepsy patients, it&rsquo;s not death due to drowning or a car accident. When they do an autopsy, there&rsquo;s no cause found. It&rsquo;s believed that seizures cause a reflex for the heart to stop beating or the lungs to stop breathing.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>How can you protect your child?</strong></p><p>Dr. Abram explained that seizures are most often triggered by not taking one&rsquo;s medication. They can also come on due to a fever or lack of sleep. Dr. Abram says the best thing children and teens with epilepsy can do is follow their care plan to a T, and parents should enforce this.</p><p>Taking precautions in other areas of daily life can prevent injury, too. For example, Dr. Abram often sees patients hurt in pools or bathrooms, so supervision is key.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re concerned or have questions, certainly talk to your doctor. You should take your medicines. Oftentimes parents and teenagers want to stop their medicines to see if they need it, but never stop your medicines without talking to your doctor. We prefer for patients to sleep on their back instead of face down so that after a seizure, when the body can be very limp, you&rsquo;re not face down in a pillow. We do recommend, depending on the age of the child, that a parent or older sibling be in the room with the child while they&rsquo;re sleeping. Or, some parents use a baby monitor.&rdquo;</p><p>Ultimately, parents should seek a neurologist who can understand their child&rsquo;s epilepsy and develop a care plan that helps manage it &mdash; while still letting them be a kid.</p><p>&ldquo;We try to balance out this rare risk of death versus providing a normal childhood,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;We try to put epilepsy in the context of the child&rsquo;s overall health and allow them to have a normal childhood that includes things like sleepovers and sports.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital is ranked by&nbsp;</em>U.S. News &amp;World Report<em>&nbsp;among the top 50 hospitals in the nation for pediatric neurology &amp; neurosurgery, and is home to the level 4 Pediatric Epilepsy Center (Level 4 designation is the highest level awarded by the National Association of Epilepsy Centers).

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Addison Slater had dreams of a summer filled with pool parties and playing with friends. But it turns out, the 10-year-old&rsquo;s heart just wasn&rsquo;t in it.</p><p>&ldquo;In our minds, everything was fine until this summer,&rdquo; Addison&rsquo;s mother, Alicia Slater, said. &ldquo;And then all of the sudden, our daughter has a pacemaker.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The first faint</strong></p><p>Addison passed out for the first time when she was just 2 years old. Three years later, it happened again, this time accompanied by a seizure. As Addison grew up, the episodes continued, and she also suffered from excruciating pain in her hands, legs and feet. She never seemed to have as much energy as her friends.</p><p>Slater took her daughter first to her pediatrician, then to a pediatric cardiologist who suspected Addison had Elhers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), a connective tissue disorder often associated with heart problems. A geneticist confirmed the diagnosis of EDS and Addison was referred to see a pediatric electrophysiologist at the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/heart/rhythm-disorders\" target=\"_blank\">UF Health Pediatric Cardiovascular Center</a>, affiliated with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p><strong>Unexpected news</strong></p><p>By the time Addison was scheduled for her follow-up appointment, a new pediatric electrophysiologist, <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-cardiologist/dr-sunita-ferns-md\" target=\"_blank\">Sunita Ferns, MD</a>, had joined the Pediatric Cardiovascular Team. Dr. Ferns is the director of the Pediatric Invasive Electrophysiology Program at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the UF Health Pediatric Cardiovascular Center. Concerned that Addison started experiencing fainting spells so early in life, Dr. Ferns scheduled a tilt table test for the very next day.</p><p>In a tilt table test, a patient is secured to a table while lying down. The table then slowly tilts up to a standing position to see how the heart responds.</p><p>&ldquo;During the test, her heart rate dropped from the hundreds to the low thirties, and I could barely feel her pulse,&rdquo; Dr. Ferns said. &ldquo;This is very rare, especially in children, and is called cardioinhibitory syncope. That means something is slowing the heart rate. If your heart&rsquo;s not beating, there&rsquo;s no blood flow going to your brain. Without blood to your brain for a period of time, it starts to get less oxygen and then the child may have life-threatening seizures.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was like this huge wave just crashed down on us,&rdquo; Slater said of receiving the news about Addison.</p><p>The solution for cardioinhibitory syncope is a pacemaker, but both Dr. Ferns and Addison&rsquo;s parents wanted to delay surgery until it was absolutely necessary. In the meantime, Dr. Ferns outfitted Addison with an injectable device called a loop recorder, which relayed real-time data to software that Dr. Ferns could access at any time.</p><p><strong>From fine to frightening</strong></p><p>For the first few weeks, Addison didn&rsquo;t have any concerning episodes where her heart rate dropped dangerously low. Addison was doing well enough that Slater took both her and her young son, Sullivan, on a family trip to Alabama. That&rsquo;s where things took a frightening turn.</p><p>&ldquo;Addison was exhausted after the day of travel and her legs and feet were hurting, so I suggested we try some pressure points we had learned to relieve the pain,&rdquo; Slater said. &ldquo;I just touched her ear, and she passed out. It was the worst episode she had ever had. Her freckles disappeared, the color in her lips disappeared and her whole body went white. Then she had a seizure and she wouldn&rsquo;t wake up.&rdquo;</p><p>Because Addison was outfitted with the loop recorder, Dr. Ferns was able to immediately pull up her heart data.</p><p>&ldquo;Addison&rsquo;s heart paused for five seconds and the seizure was caused by lack of oxygen to her brain,&rdquo; Slater said. &ldquo;Her pulse after that was around 15 beats per minute.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s an average of one beat every four seconds, which can be deadly.</p><p><strong>On pace for a healthy future</strong></p><div class=\"u-size1of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1568120581/Juice/addisons_pacemaker.jpg\" alt=\"Pacemaker\"></div><p>In early July 2019, Dr. Ferns performed surgery at the Cardiac Catheterization Lab at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital to place Addison&rsquo;s pacemaker. When putting in the pacemaker, Dr. Ferns had to make sure the leads &ndash; the wires connecting the device to Addison&rsquo;s heart &ndash; were long enough to accommodate Addison&rsquo;s growing body over the next several years. Addison was able to go home after an overnight stay in the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit.</p><p>&ldquo;I chose a unique algorithm for Addison&rsquo;s pacemaker that detects changes in her heart contracting before the heart rate actually drops,&rdquo; Dr. Ferns said. The pacemaker is set to activate when Addison&rsquo;s heart rate drops below 50 beats per minute. It is currently triggered about 50% of the time, demonstrating how badly Addison needs it.</p><p>&ldquo;My hope is that as she grows, she might outgrow her symptoms,&rdquo; Dr. Ferns said. &ldquo;The hope is that, with this state-of-the-art pacemaker, she will never experience the scary symptoms she had on vacation again.&rdquo;</p><p>While Addison has to recover from the heart procedure itself, she shouldn&rsquo;t have any long-term limitations from the pacemaker. In fact, it should allow her to have the energy to keep up with her friends. For Slater, the pacemaker provides peace of mind that her daughter will be okay.</p><p>&ldquo;If Dr. Ferns hadn&rsquo;t done that tilt table test to realize how bad Addison&rsquo;s condition really was, my daughter might have gone to bed one night and not have woken up the next day,&rdquo; Slater said.</p><p><em>While Addison&rsquo;s exact condition is rare, other heart rhythm disorders are more common in children.

The other measured 1.7mm.</p><p>Neurosurgeons often recommend surgical treatment for any aneurysm measuring more than 5 millimeters.</p><p>&ldquo;They told me the larger one had probably been there for five years, but I never had any symptoms until last May,&rdquo; said the 78-year-old Mandarin resident, who spent nearly 30 years in medical billing. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t na&iuml;ve about aneurysms.

The catheter is guided through a blood vessel and up into the brain using fluoroscopy, a type of medical imaging that shows a continuous X-ray image of a moving body structure on a monitor, much like an X-ray movie.</p><p>After her surgery, Gaudet spent the night in the Neurocritical Care Unit at Baptist Jacksonville and was discharged from the hospital the following morning.</p><p>&ldquo;I expected to have some discomfort after the surgery, but I wasn&rsquo;t even sore,&rdquo; said Gaudet.</p><p>&ldquo;Because of her age, it&rsquo;s extremely unlikely that she will develop another aneurysm, but there&rsquo;s always a small possibility that the ones we treated may regrow,&rdquo; said Dr. Sauvageau. &ldquo;We will monitor her via MRI just to keep an eye on them.&rdquo;</p><p>Gaudet, who aspires to live to be 100, said every time she sees Dr. Sauvageau, she just wants to throw her arms around him and tell him how much she appreciates his total commitment to her care.</p><p>&ldquo;I will be forever grateful to him for the rest of my life,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m his biggest cheerleader.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Symptoms of a brain aneurysm</strong></p><p>A brain aneurysm that has not ruptured often does not cause any symptoms and may not pose an immediate health risk, especially if the aneurysm is small.</p><p>Over time, an aneurysm may grow larger and press up against delicate nerves and tissue in the brain.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>The vitamin aisle at the grocery store can be a daunting place. What&rsquo;s the difference between vitamins B5 and B2? Am I getting enough of either?</p><p>While it can be tempting to pack your cart with vitamin supplements, or a multivitamin that contains them all, do you really need it?</p><p>More than half of all Americans take vitamin supplements, according to an article from the New York Times, and we spend nearly $30 billion a year on dietary supplements.</p><p>While the human body needs vitamins for normal functions, we can&rsquo;t make them on our own, with the exception of vitamin D. Therefore, we have to eat them. Deficiency of certain vitamins can lead to conditions like scurvy and pellagra. Trust me &ndash; neither of those is pleasant.</p><p><strong>Eat your vitamins</strong></p><p>Diets high in antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, unprocessed foods, plant-based fats and proteins, legumes, whole grains and nuts help you get your vitamins naturally. Fruits and vegetables should be half of every meal, with nine servings a day in a variety of colors to maximize intake of various vitamins. Legumes include a variety of beans that contain iron, B vitamins and minerals. One-and-a-half to three cups of legumes a week are recommended. &nbsp;</p><p>But even healthy eaters may not get all the vitamins they need from diet alone. Supplements may, or may not, be the answer.</p><p>Vitamins A, D, E and K are fat-soluble, meaning they are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body&rsquo;s fatty tissue. If too much of any of these vitamins is absorbed into the system, it can build up to toxic levels and can cause harm. Vitamin D increases calcium in the blood that can cause nausea, vomiting, urinary frequency and weakness. Vitamin A can cause vision changes, bone pain and skin changes. Excess vitamin E can cause muscle weakness, fatigue, nausea and diarrhea. Vitamin K toxicity is mostly associated with injectable supplements but oral vitamin K can interfere with blood thinners. Studies show increased risk of cardiovascular disease with vitamins A and E.</p><p>The other vitamins are water-soluble, and excess absorbed levels are released in the urine, avoiding a toxic buildup.</p><div class=\"u-size4of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1567172072/Juice/Vitamin_Wheel_Graphic.jpg\" alt=\"VitaminWheel\"></div><p><strong>What&rsquo;s the deal with deficiencies?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/primary-care/whats-the-big-d\" target=\"_blank\">Vitamin D</a> deficiency may contribute to the development of osteoporosis, falls and fractures in older adults. Because it is one of the fat-soluble vitamins, toxicity is a concern but is rare. The upper limit for vitamin D is 4000 units daily for healthy adults.</p><p>Multiple studies have shown vitamin A supplementation has no benefit in prevention of cataracts or macular degeneration, which is the deterioration of the small central area of the retina and the leading cause of vision loss among people 50 and older. Supplementation of vitamin A is not recommended as risk for harm is greater than potential for benefit.</p><p>High doses of vitamin C, 1000 mg daily, have shown some benefit in preventing the common cold if taken with exposure. Taking daily high-dose vitamin C does not show the same benefit and can increase the risk of kidney stones.</p><p>Vitamin E doses greater than 400 units daily might increase risk of death from all causes. A select trial followed more than 35,500 men for around seven years. Compared with those taking a placebo, those taking vitamin E supplements had an increased risk of prostate cancer. Additionally, vitamin E supplementation may increase the risk of heart failure. In a study of non-institutionalized older adults who had been experiencing a respiratory infection, those who received vitamin E had significantly longer total illness duration, more symptoms, and a higher frequency of fever and activity restriction. A meta-analysis of randomized trials of vitamin E supplementation examined the effects of supplementation on all-cause mortality, which was found to be increased in patients receiving high-dose vitamin E supplementation.</p><p>B vitamins are available in many foods and deficiencies are rare, except for B12. Vitamin B12 is found only in animal products. Genetic factors, interference from medications, and age may contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do I need a multivitamin?</strong></p><p>Multivitamin supplementation should be considered for those at risk of vitamin deficiency. That includes people with alcoholism, poor-quality and vegan diets, those who have had gastric bypass surgery or gastric sleeve surgery, and those taking medications that reduce vitamin absorption.</p><p>Taking a multivitamin may be more beneficial than taking supplements of individual components, and the level of fat-soluble vitamins in multivitamins is safe. Multivitamins should not be taken to prevent cancer or heart disease in those with a healthy diet. In the case of vitamins, more is not better.

The major surgery that had been hanging over her head for months was finally over.</p><p>The proctocolectomy and ileal J-pouch procedure, which involved removing her entire colon and rectum and then creating a new internal pouch out of her small intestine (J-pouch), had been a long time coming&mdash;she had suffered with ulcerative colitis for 20 years, managing her symptoms with medication, and never wanting to have the surgery. It wasn&rsquo;t until she was diagnosed with a stricture, a tightening of the colon, that she was forced to reconsider.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/colon-and-rectal-surgeon/dr-ron-landmann-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ron G.

It would be worth it in the long run, a valuable preventive measure, while maintaining and improving her quality of life.</p><p>But after the procedure, Porter&rsquo;s health problems weren&rsquo;t over.</p><p>The then-49-year-old was preparing to leave the hospital and return home when Dr. Landmann came into her room with some bad news.</p><p>The pathology report revealed Stage IIIB colon cancer, which required immediate additional treatment.</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody thinks they&rsquo;re going to have a cancer diagnosis,&rdquo; Porter said. &ldquo;This was truly not part of my life plan.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Landmann and his team sprang into action. He worked with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/hematologist-oncologist/dr-anterpreet-neki-md\" target=\"_blank\">Anterpreet Neki, MD</a>, Baptist MD Anderson hematologist/oncologist, to create a multidisciplinary plan for Porter&rsquo;s care within two hours of her diagnosis. This included taking advantage of the state-of-the-art resources and facilities at Baptist MD Anderson to set up a medical oncology consultation.</p><p>&ldquo;The ability to provide personalized and individualized multidisciplinary team management of patients is a distinguishing hallmark of Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center,&rdquo; Dr. Landmann said. &ldquo;Improving this quality and value of care, with a focus on the patient, is what drives us!&rdquo;</p><p><strong>From Stage 3B to healing stage</strong></p><p>The six months that followed blurred together as Porter recovered from surgery and then went through 12 rounds of chemo.</p><p>She credits the support systems of her family, work colleagues, and the team at Baptist MD Anderson for helping her get through this trying time. Her mom, husband, and sister assisted her every step of the way, as did her sister&rsquo;s dog Sadie, a miniature Chihuahua who Porter came to refer to as her therapy pet.</p><p>Porter wrapped up her treatment in May, and now she just needs to go in for periodic check-ins.</p><p>&ldquo;Her outgoing personality, drive, and outlook on life were huge contributors to her overall recuperation,&rdquo; Dr. Landmann said.</p><p>While she was thrilled to be done, the moment was also bittersweet because she had to say goodbye to the Baptist MD Anderson team who had been by her side throughout her journey.</p><p>Her next step? Sharing her story to help those battling a similar diagnosis, or wondering if they should treat their ulcerative colitis with surgical measures.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr Landmann told me &lsquo;You will inspire others,&rsquo; and I didn&rsquo;t believe it at the time, but he was so right,&rdquo; Porter said.</p><p><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p><p>Porter has started a new role as a deputy human capital officer, transitioning from supervising 13 employees to oversight for almost 40. She works 12-hour days&mdash;and loves every minute of the return to her normal routine.</p><p>When one of her staff members or one of their loved ones gets diagnosed with cancer, she is there to share her story and show her support. For the 20 years she suffered with ulcerative colitis, she didn&rsquo;t tell anyone about what she was going through. Since her surgery and cancer treatment, she wants to be more vocal and serve as someone who others can lean on.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel like my old self,&rdquo; Porter said. &ldquo;I never dreamed that after they took out two of my organs, I could be exactly who I was before, or better.&rdquo;</p><p>Porter stayed strong throughout her surgery and cancer treatments, rarely breaking down because she knew she had to focus on taking the steps she needed to heal.</p><p>She did get emotional when she sat down to write a 3-page thank you letter to Dr. Landmann.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know how you say thank you to somebody who saves your life,&rdquo; Porter said. &ldquo;There is no question in my mind that I would not have been successful if he had not gotten me to that operating table.&rdquo;</p><p>For Dr. Landmann, the letter also had a special meaning.</p><p>&ldquo;I was blown away,&rdquo; Landmann said. &ldquo;You could tell she put a lot of thought and effort into it. She is an extraordinarily caring and loving person. Working with Candy and her husband, and seeing her outcome reinforced why I went into the field of medicine, and surgery in particular, in the first place.

Who will be the lucky person she someday marries? When Miriam Simmons looks at her 9-month-old daughter, Mya, she imagines one thing that seems so simple.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to hear her speak,&rdquo; Simmons said. &ldquo;After all this, I can&rsquo;t wait to hear what thoughts she has.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Change of plans</strong></p><p>If Mya could talk, she&rsquo;d tell you about her journey that began weeks before she entered this world. At a 30-week ultrasound, Simmons, who then lived in Tallahassee, was told her baby had a mass on her brain. The &ldquo;mass&rdquo; turned out to be hemimegalencephaly, a disorder that causes one half of the brain to be larger than the other, leading to seizures.</p><p>In the weeks that followed, Simmons and her husband, Alex, made a plan on where to deliver and a course of action to follow after, but Mya decided to come early, forcing them to adjust.</p><p>Mya was born at a hospital in Tallahassee on October 1, 2018, and almost immediately started seizing. She was transported via <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/emergency/critical-care-transport\" target=\"_blank\">Kids Kare Mobile ICU</a> to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville and directly admitted to the Level 4 <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/supporting-services/nicu\" target=\"_blank\">Neonatal Intensive Care Unit</a>, where she remained for a couple of weeks. Simmons, who was recovering from a cesarean section, had to stay behind for 24 hours before following her baby girl to Jacksonville.</p><p>After Mya was discharged, Simmons noticed something still seemed off about her baby.</p><p>&ldquo;She was having these little episodes, I couldn&rsquo;t really tell what they were,&rdquo; Simmons said. &ldquo;When we came back to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s in November for a follow-up appointment, they did another 48-hour electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures brain waves and electrical activity in the brain. They said it looked like a seizure.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Two conditions, one baby girl</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-neurosurgeon/dr-alexandra-beier-do\" target=\"_blank\">Alexandra Beier, DO</a>, pediatric neurosurgeon with the UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville and neurosurgical director of Wolfson Children&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/brain/epilepsy-and-seizures\" target=\"_blank\">Pediatric Epilepsy Program</a>, said that because seizures caused by hemimegalencephaly are known to be unresponsive to medication, surgery is often necessary.</p><p>&ldquo;The surgery to address her seizures is termed a hemispherotomy. &nbsp;This is a long procedure, as you need to identify the connections between the cerebral hemispheres, and disconnect them,&rdquo; said Dr. Beier. &ldquo;With the length of surgery, blood loss and the general risks of anesthesia, the patient&rsquo;s size is very important. &nbsp;With Mya, we delayed surgery until she had gained enough weight to tolerate the surgery.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1567092997/Juice/Mya_CT_scan.png\" alt=\"CTScan\"></div><p>Further complicating Mya&rsquo;s care plan was the discovery that she also had <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/brain/craniosynostosis\" target=\"_blank\">craniosynostosis</a>, the premature fusion of one or more of the sutures (growth plates) in the skull. It occurs in about three of every 10,000 live births worldwide.</p><p>&ldquo;In addition to the progressive head shape abnormality and impairment of normal brain growth that occurs over time, patients with craniosynostosis are at risk for developing signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure such as headaches, visual impairment and nausea if left untreated,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-neurosurgeon/dr-nathan-ranalli-md\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Ranalli, MD</a>, pediatric neurosurgeon with the UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville and neurosurgical director of Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Craniofacial, Spasticity and Brachial Plexus Programs.</p><p><strong>A surgical first</strong></p><p>The solution would be a revolutionary set of surgeries never before performed simultaneously &nbsp;at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, thanks to a collaboration and a great deal of planning by Dr. Ranalli and Dr. Beier.</p><p>On April 18, 2019, Simmons, who had moved with her family to Clay County, took then-6-month-old Mya to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s for what would be a more-than-13-hour surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;They were wheeling her away and her little body didn&rsquo;t even take up half the bed,&rdquo; Simmons recalled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always remember how she just looked so little.&rdquo;</p><p>Both surgeons began the procedure together. Then, Dr. Ranalli performed his portion to treat the craniosynostosis by removing the bone at the top of the skull where the sagittal suture, which runs through the center of the skull from front to back, had prematurely closed. Then, Dr. Beier performed a peri-insular hemispherotomy, in which she disconnected the left half of the brain from the right.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;There are several points of connection from one hemisphere to another,&rdquo; said Dr. Beier. &ldquo;The goal is for the abnormal brain where seizures are arising from to be physically disconnected from the brain that is not having seizures. Therefore the abnormal brain may still have abnormal activity but it can&rsquo;t affect the healthy brain because it&rsquo;s no longer connected.&rdquo;</p><p>Mya recovered well following surgery and was able to go home after a weeklong stay in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and the Neuroscience Unit at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. She has been seizure-free since surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s able to finally hold her head up and do those things that she wasn&rsquo;t able to do before,&rdquo; Simmons said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a funny little one. She laughs at everything, she&rsquo;s so happy.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Reshaping the future</strong></p><p>Mya will have to wear a customized helmet 23 hours a day, seven days a week for the next year to help reshape her skull from the craniosynostosis. As for the seizures, Dr. Beier said she is cautiously optimistic until Mya is completely weaned off seizure medication, a lengthy process that won&rsquo;t start for another year or two.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1567092999/Juice/mya_mom_and_drs.jpg\" alt=\"Mya\"></div><p>Now, Mya is full of giggles when she plays with her 3-year-old sister.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>A new diet trend called &ldquo;intermittent fasting&rdquo; was recently featured on the Today Show. The diet is an eating pattern that alternates between fasting and eating, and focuses more on when you eat rather than what you eat.</p><p>The most popular plan is fasting for 16 hours, followed by an eight-hour eating window, typically between 8 am and 2 pm. Another method is alternating 500-calorie days with eating normally, and fasting for two days (not in a row) within a week.</p><p>While it hasn&rsquo;t been scientifically proven, a study in <em>The Journal of Obesity&nbsp;</em>reports that intermittent fasting works by curbing appetite rather than by burning more calories. The report states that this eating method decreases ghrelin, the hunger hormone, while increasing leptin, the satiety hormone.</p><p>The same study shows that fasting prompts obese people to dip into their fat reserves, causing them to burn more fat.</p><p>&ldquo;I have seen success with intermittent fasting for some of my patients with a BMI of 40 or higher, which is considered obese,&rdquo; said Jillian McMullen, a registered dietitian at the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/bariatric-surgery\">Baptist Center for Bariatrics.</a> &ldquo;It can also help jump-start weight loss if a patient reaches a plateau after having weight-loss surgery.&rdquo;</p><p>McMullen said it&rsquo;s important to eat healthy during the eating window and not to overeat. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go crazy during the non-fasting hours. You still have to be controlled and eat sensibly or it will defeat the purpose,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>For people who want to lose a moderate amount of weight, say 10-20 pounds, intermittent fasting may help for a short period of time.</p><p>&ldquo;As with any type of fad diet,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-patricia-calhoun-md\">Patricia Calhoun, MD,</a> a family care physician with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\">Baptist Primary Care,</a> &ldquo;the concern is for long-term sustainability. There are a few studies that show that intermittent fasting is probably equal to other healthy calorie-restricted eating plans&mdash;but not tremendously better.&rdquo;</p><p>One tip for curbing feelings of hunger while fasting includes eating high-fiber foods like nuts, beans, fruits and vegetables, along with high-protein foods like meat, fish, tofu or nuts, during the eating window. Drinking 64 or more ounces of water a day may also be helpful.</p><p>Always check with your doctor before starting a new diet. &ldquo;Some people are not good candidates for this type of diet,&rdquo; said Dr. Calhoun. &ldquo;This includes pregnant women, lactating women, those with certain eating disorders, and diabetics who require strict glucose monitoring. Always check with your physician before beginning any significantly rigorous diet or exercise program.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you are looking for a primary care physician, call <a href=\"tel:1-904-202-4968\">904-202-4YOU (4968)</a> or visit <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\">Baptist Primary Care.</a> </em></p>",

Varicose veins are more than just a cosmetic concern. They can lead to pain and in some cases, may be a sign of a serious health condition.</p><p>And varicose veins are nothing new. They were described in the Ebers Papyrus &ndash; a compilation of Egyptian herbal knowledge that dates back to 1550 B.C. &ndash; as &ldquo;tortuous and solid, with many knots, as if blown up by air.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Varicose veins are swollen, twisted veins that become visible just under the skin, usually on the legs and thighs,&rdquo; explained <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-nehu-patel-md\" target=\"_blank\">Nehu Patel, MD</a>, a cardiologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a>. &ldquo;Muscles in our legs help push oxygen-poor blood back to our heart, and the valves in our veins prevent the blood from flowing back down. When valves are damaged or become weak over time, it causes the blood to pool in the legs.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1566233883/Juice/Varicose_Veins-secondary.jpg\" alt=\"VaricoseVeins\"></div><p>The buildup of blood in the legs causes the swelling, bulging and blue appearance associated with varicose veins. In addition to cosmetic concerns, varicose veins can cause pain, aching, throbbing, cramping and itching.</p><p><strong>Preventing the problem</strong></p><p>&ldquo;You can minimize varicose veins by exercising regularly, walking frequently and wearing compression stockings, especially if your profession requires standing for long periods of time,&rdquo; explained Dr. Patel. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re traveling on a plane that requires sitting for more than two hours, be sure to stand up and walk around to prevent clots.&rdquo;</p><p>Even in more modern history, compression stockings and support clothes were incorporated into professional uniforms for nurses, doctors, airline hostesses and more. Historical documentation also shows many soldiers suffered from varicose veins in the 1930s and 1940s, the result of walking long distances carrying heavy backpacks and weapons.</p><p>Today, compression stockings aren&rsquo;t always required as part of a professional uniform, but they&rsquo;re highly encouraged by physicians like Dr. Patel, especially if you have a family history of varicose veins or stand for long periods of time.</p><p>&ldquo;For women, varicose veins often appear during or after pregnancy,&rdquo; said Dr. Patel. &ldquo;Multiple pregnancies and the pregnant uterus can compress deep veins, causing varicose veins.&rdquo; Men often start to see varicose veins in their 40s or 50s.</p><p><strong>Treating the trouble</strong></p><p>While about 1 in 5 adults will develop varicose veins, not everyone needs to see a doctor or have professional treatment.</p><p>&ldquo;If the veins become red, swollen or painful or your legs are so tired and heavy at the end of the day that you can&rsquo;t do anything, it&rsquo;s time to see a physician,&rdquo; said Dr. Patel.</p><p>Rather than fully remove the faulty veins with traditional surgery, Dr. Patel uses endovenous ablation, a new minimally invasive treatment option that requires only local anesthesia. In the procedure, a catheter is guided into the vein and laser energy is exerted to close off the veins causing the buildup, allowing normal blood flow back to the heart.</p><p>From 1550 B.C. to 2019, humans have had pain from varicose veins. Thankfully, the treatment options today are anything but ancient.</p><p><em>Suffering from pain with varicose veins?

In fact, it can be downright painful if you tend to fight dirty. When it comes to disagreements large or small, having a productive argument requires effective communication.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-henry-benson-phd\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Benson, PhD</a>, a licensed psychologist at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>, said effective communication is the main ingredient in a healthy relationship and helps couples have more successful arguments. A &ldquo;successful&rdquo; argument is one that ends with both parties feeling heard and keeps the relationship moving forward toward a solution.</p><p>While every couple is unique and relationships are complex, these eight tips for better communication can help make any disagreement more productive.</p><p><strong>1. Stick to the facts.</strong></p><p>When having a disagreement with your partner, it&rsquo;s important not to get swept up in your feelings about the problem, but rather, direct your attention to what&rsquo;s actually happening.</p><p>&ldquo;Focus on specific facts of the situation. Both in your perception of the situation and when expressing your concerns, consider the clear, objective reality,&rdquo; said Dr. Benson. &ldquo;Granulize concerns into very specific details. Doing this allows for a deeper understanding of the problem and increased recognition of having some degree of control.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>2. Stay on topic.</strong></p><p>Both parties should try to stick to the problem at hand. Bringing up unrelated issues or past grievances just muddies the water.</p><p>&ldquo;Avoid bringing up or responding to other concerns. If your partner attempts to go off-topic, consider a statement such as, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s something we can talk about at some point, but let&rsquo;s try to resolve this first.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p><strong>3. Choose one takeaway for your partner.</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to think of a laundry list of lessons you want your partner to learn in an argument, but the best strategy is to prioritize one key point. Give that point the most time in the conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the most critical objective of the conversation? What is the one point you want to be remembered when the conversation is over? Present this point clearly and concisely. Avoid focusing on blame or attacking,&rdquo; said Dr. Benson.</p><p><strong>4. Listen. Like, really listen.</strong></p><p>Active listening is key to healthy communication in any type of relationship. Listening fully to what your partner says before thinking of your own response will ensure you don&rsquo;t miss anything they say.</p><p>&ldquo;The most significant elements of healthy communication are listening and validation,&rdquo; Dr. Benson said. &ldquo;Listen with compassion and the desire to understand &mdash; it demonstrates respect and genuine investment in the relationship. When a person feels genuinely appreciated and understood, they feel safe enough to be willing to consider options and to be able to focus on mutually acceptable solutions.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>5. Be willing to negotiate.</strong></p><p>About those mutually acceptable solutions, Dr. Benson recommended approaching tough conversations with a willingness to help your partner meet your needs. In some cases, letting it go is best, but when fixing the issue really matters, be prepared to help along the way.</p><p>&ldquo;In negotiating a problem, the critical element is effective listening. Understanding your partner&rsquo;s concerns and fears allows you to offer solutions that are more likely to be mutually acceptable,&rdquo; said Dr. Benson. &ldquo;Be fair to yourself as well. Consider your values and maintain self-respect. Recognize that you also deserve to be treated with fairness and respect. Ask yourself, &lsquo;How much will this matter to me next week or next month?&rsquo; This can decrease the emotional intensity of the moment. If it is going to remain a critical issue, you need to remain firm. Consider what you can do to make the solution easier or more likely to occur.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>6. Be solution-oriented.</strong></p><p>Sure, sometimes it just feels good to vent and tell your partner how angry, upset or disappointed they made you. In fact, Dr. Benson believes not all disputes require a solution; some just require a good vent session. However, this shouldn&rsquo;t be the point of every argument. When appropriate, both partners should look for a mutually beneficial solution and make a plan to execute it.</p><p>&ldquo;Focus on solutions. Remember, this is a partnership. How can you work together to address the concerns? Discuss the positive aspects and benefits of what you&rsquo;re suggesting and solicit possible solutions from your partner as well,&rdquo; Dr. Benson recommended.</p><p><strong>7. Communicate your needs before a misunderstanding.</strong></p><p>There&rsquo;s no crystal ball that will reveal what your partner is thinking, and they don&rsquo;t have one for you, either. Bummer, right? As a result, it&rsquo;s crucial to make your wants, needs and expectations clear to your partner throughout the relationship.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&#39;t assume that your partner knows what you want or how you feel. Yes, we would love for our partner to understand our needs, but not being able to read your mind doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t love and care deeply about you. It&rsquo;s so much easier to just ask for what you need rather than waiting to see if you&#39;ll be disappointed. Express feelings honestly and calmly, focusing more on your reaction rather than blaming your partner for causing your feelings,&rdquo; Dr. Benson explained.</p><p><strong>8. Just be nice.</strong></p><p>It should go without saying that kindness and consideration during a hard conversation can go a long way, but sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to be nice when your partner has hurt you. Even if you have to think of it as killing them with kindness, being loving during conflict is always more effective than yelling and quarreling.</p><p>&ldquo;Be gentle, respectful and easy to talk to. Try not to judge, threaten or attack. Remember first and foremost that you love this person, and how important it is to you that they are not getting hurt. Show genuine consideration and compassion.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you and your partner are interested in couples&rsquo; therapy, consider making an appointment with a psychologist to get support and learn more.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>You may have noticed stories about Vitamin D in the news lately. The so-called &ldquo;sunshine vitamin&rdquo; not only strengthens bones &ndash; it&rsquo;s reported to have other important health benefits as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Some studies have shown that vitamin D can lower your risk of heart disease, some forms of cancer, diabetes and depression,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-michael-young-md\">Michael Young, MD,</a> a primary care physician at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\">Baptist Primary Care</a> in Tapestry Park.</p><p>Although the studies are not definitive, there&rsquo;s no doubt that vitamin D plays an important role in overall health, according to Dr. Young. Its main function is promoting calcium absorption to strengthen bones, but it also helps regulate the immune and neuromuscular systems and plays a major role in reducing inflammation.</p><p>&ldquo;Every cell in your body has a vitamin D receptor,&rdquo; said Dr. Young. &ldquo;It regulates genes that control cell growth and development, immune function and metabolic control. Yet 42% of Americans are deficient in vitamin D.&rdquo;</p><p>This could be because many people don&rsquo;t get enough sun, the primary way to get vitamin D. &ldquo;To make enough vitamin D, you need between five and 30 minutes of sun twice a week,&rdquo; said Dr. Young.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean slathering on the baby oil and sunbathing like in the good old days. Just getting outdoors &ndash; going for a walk or a bike ride a couple of times a week will help increase your vitamin D levels. If you have a history of skin cancer, you should find alternative ways to boost vitamin D.</p><p>Eating vitamin-D-rich foods can help boost your levels. The Institute of Medicine recommends 1000&ndash;4000 IU (international units), or 25&ndash;100 micrograms daily. Here are some foods that are high in vitamin D:</p><ul><li>Salmon</li><li>Herring and sardines</li><li>Cod liver oil</li><li>Canned tuna</li><li>Oysters</li><li>Shrimp</li><li>Egg yolks</li><li>Mushrooms</li></ul><p>There are other foods that are fortified with vitamin D, such as cow&rsquo;s milk, soy milk and some types of orange juice and oatmeal.</p><p>If those foods don&rsquo;t spark your taste buds, you can take an over-the-counter vitamin D supplement. &ldquo;Make sure you get Vitamin D3 rather than D2 &ndash; &nbsp;it may cost a bit more, but it is better at sustaining adequate blood levels of vitamin D,&rdquo; said Dr. Young.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about your vitamin D level, talk to your primary care doctor.</p><p><em>If you are looking for a primary care physician, call <a href=\"http://1-904-202-4953\">904-202-4YOU</a> or visit&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/care-coordinator-request\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a>.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>",

But it&rsquo;s really Yanira&rsquo;s quincea&ntilde;era.</p><p>For young women growing up in the Latino culture, their quincea&ntilde;era is a celebration of their 15th birthday, a day honoring their transition from childhood to adulthood.</p><p>August 17 is a day that is even more significant for Yanira and her family because on this day, the Interlachen, Florida, teen who was born with spina bifida will use her new power chair to stand up and dance with her dad for the first time. She hopes this moment will be symbolic not only for her but for all of those with special needs.</p><p>&ldquo;I just want to change the world!&rdquo; said Yanira.</p><p>Thanks to her brand new Permobil power wheelchair from Numotion, the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/rehabilitation\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Rehab</a> patient can rise to a standing position and sway to the beat of the music with her dad at her Beauty and the Beast-themed party. She has two gold ball gowns to complete her Beauty look, and her dad has graciously agreed to play the part of the Beast.</p><p><strong>New wheels</strong></p><p>The power chair Yanira has received is a very expensive medical device, and she and her family were worried about how much it would cost.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to get my hopes up,&rdquo; Yanira said. But then her care team at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Rehab told her &ldquo;Keep your hopes high.&rdquo;</p><p>Yanira and her mom were taking a break between doctor&rsquo;s appointments on June 28, looking for dolphins on a walkway by the St. Johns River near Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. Sometimes, there are flocks of dolphins whose fins pop up above the surface of the water, but on that day there was only one.</p><p>Del Valle&rsquo;s phone rang, and she got the news that Yanira would be getting her chair.</p><p>As if on cue, a flock of dolphin fins appeared on the St. John&rsquo;s, celebrating along with them. &ldquo;It was like magic,&rdquo; Del Valle said.</p><p>Yanira&rsquo;s care team was able to medically justify the need for this specialized chair, which fortunately her insurance was then able to cover.</p><p>Since she got her power chair, which is complete with headlights, taillights, and blinkers, Yanira has enjoyed racing after her friends. She&rsquo;s also looking forward to going to high school. She had to be home-schooled for the past three years because medical procedures required her to miss days of school at a time, but this month she&rsquo;ll head to Interlachen High School for her freshman year.</p><p>All of these positive moments in Yanira&rsquo;s life, from her quincea&ntilde;era to her return to school, would not have been possible without the help of her care team at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, including <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatric-physiatrist/dr-christine-thorogood-md\" target=\"_blank\">Christine Thorogood, MD</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-physiatrist/dr-louise-spierre-md\" target=\"_blank\">Louise Spierre, MD</a>, pediatric physiatrists with the UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville; and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Rehab&rsquo;s Lisa Towery, a pediatric occupational therapist, Madelyn Jones, a pediatric physical therapist, and Karen Reckamp, a pediatric rehabilitation manager and pediatric occupational therapist. Before getting her chair, the Wolfson team had Yanira practice standing at home for 15 to 20 minutes a day beginning in the fall of 2018, helping to build her strength.</p><p>Yanira&rsquo;s can-do spirit has also shaped her outcomes and made these milestones possible.</p><p>&ldquo;When she comes into a room, the room lights up,&rdquo; Dr. Spierre said. &ldquo;She always approaches challenges with a very positive attitude, and her mom does, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Towery and Jones said Yanira has grown so much in the two years they have worked with her.</p><p>She has gained range of motion in her knees and ankles and increased the strength and bone density in her legs. With the help of braces and her new chair, she&rsquo;ll be able to be at eye level with her peers in high school. When her mom transfers Yanira from her chair to the car or her bed, she can bear some of the weight in her legs and help out.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-orthopedic-surgeon/dr-marielle-amoli-md\" target=\"_blank\">Marielle Amoli, MD</a>, a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, performed a procedure in 2018 that involved rerouting muscles in her right wrist. The procedure helped Yanira to gain more movement and has made it possible for her to assist with tasks including feeding herself. She&rsquo;s also been able to use her hand to paint, write, and guide her wheelchair.</p><p>Yanira has become more confident too, directing her therapists in how she wants to move and being more open about her goals for improving her mobility. Now, her care team is looking forward to hearing about her return to school and seeing her enjoy life as a teenager.</p><p>Towery and Jones said Yanira has many abilities and strengths that will ensure her continued success at home, at school, and out in the community.</p><p><strong>The next big thing</strong></p><p>For Yanira, the chair is the first of many big changes to come. Her goal is to become a fashion designer specializing in creating clothing for those with special needs.</p><p>Her first step toward achieving this goal is getting some experience as a model on December 8 at the <a href=\"https://womensboardwolfsonchildrenshospital.com/art-antiques-show/childrens-fashion-show/\" target=\"_blank\">Art &amp; Antiques Show&rsquo;s annual Children&rsquo;s Fashion Show</a>, produced by <a href=\"https://womensboardwolfsonchildrenshospital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Women&rsquo;s Board of Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>. Through the lens of fashion, Yanira plans to acknowledge the sadness and anger that comes with being confined to a wheelchair, but also show off the newfound confidence and strength she has gained over the years. She wants to inspire others to support those with special needs.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to show people that we are people who need help, and I want people to care about us,&rdquo; Yanira said.</p><p><em>If you are interested in learning more about the comprehensive therapy services available at Wolfson Rehabilitation, please visit <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/\" target=\"_blank\">wolfsonchildrens.com</a>.</em></p>",

One beverage means one serving, so 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of liquor.</p><p>&ldquo;When we talk about cancer-causing agents, we don&rsquo;t talk enough about alcohol, and that needs to change,&rdquo; Dr. Crozier said. &ldquo;I think the Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; decision to label alcohol as a carcinogen is a good first step, but the responsibility lies with each of us to limit our own alcohol consumption accordingly.&rdquo;</p><p>The risk of developing an alcohol-related cancer increases the more a person drinks, but <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/hematologist-oncologist/dr-robert-zaiden-md\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Zaiden, MD</a>, a hematologist/oncologist at Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center, said even light alcohol consumption (less than the recommended one drink a day for women or two for men) over a long period of time increases cancer risk.</p><p>When the body breaks down alcohol, it releases acetaldehyde, a toxic chemical and known carcinogen. Alcohol also causes nutritional deficiencies&mdash;the more you drink, the less B12 and folic acid your body will maintain. B12 keeps nerve and blood cells healthy, while folic acid aids in cell reproduction. In addition, alcohol consumption leads to hormone imbalances, increasing estrogen levels in both women and men.</p><p>Alcohol can also cause cancer in more indirect ways by leading to an increased risk of obesity, which is also linked to increased cancer risk.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never too late to stop drinking,&rdquo; Dr. Zaiden said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re already exposed to a lot of different harmful things in our environment. You shouldn&rsquo;t be adding more things into the mix.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Zaiden suggests talking with your doctor during your next health screening to learn more. Your physician may be able to adjust your screening based on how much you drink.</p><p><em>If you have questions or concerns about the link between alcohol consumption and cancer, talk to your Baptist Health primary care physician.

She was still sleeping in the downstairs bedroom as she regained strength to climb up and down the stairs.</p><p>The inseparable couple always went to appointments together, and it wasn&rsquo;t like Marvin to not be on time.</p><p>But Marlene heard no response when she called. She knew he was tired from planning the upcoming Passover Seder for family and friends, but she didn&rsquo;t want to be late.</p><p><strong>&lsquo;I was totally disoriented&rsquo;</strong></p><p>Earlier that morning, around 8:15am, Marvin chatted with his daughter on her way to work, a daily routine he enjoyed very much.&nbsp;</p><p>An hour after the phone call, when Marlene went to check on Marvin upstairs, he could barely talk. With slurred speech, unable to move his right arm, he managed to mumble, &ldquo;My muscles feel weird.&rdquo;</p><p>Marlene panicked and called their daughter, Mandy, who verified her dad sounded normal on the phone earlier. Mandy was screaming to call 911, rushed to her parents&rsquo; house and raced up the stairs. The ambulance was on the way.</p><p>When the first responders arrived, Marvin could barely speak. &ldquo;I was totally disoriented,&rdquo; he recalled.</p><p>The first responders had Marvin in the ambulance in no time.

Several others were initially misdiagnosed.</p><p>Local news reported this month on a Cyclospora outbreak that affected dozens. Last week, the FDA reported that outbreaks in Florida and 10 other states may have been caused by fresh basil imported from Mexico by Siga Logistics de RL de CV. The diagnoses came recently, but symptoms began appearing more than a month ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Is it hard to know if you have food poisoning? Why did it take patients weeks to identify the source of their upset stomachs and diarrhea?</p><p>The type of pathogen was likely the reason, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-peter-jansen-md\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Jansen, MD</a>, a family doctor at Baptist Primary Care on Fleming Island.</p><p>&ldquo;With Cyclospora, it sometimes takes a week or more for the symptoms to appear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking&mdash;what did I do yesterday? You don&#39;t think back to a week earlier when you actually ate the food.&rdquo;</p><p>There are 31 bacteria, parasites and viruses that can cause food poisoning, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Depending on which one is responsible, food poisoning can hit almost immediately, or after several weeks.</p><p>Norovirus, Salmonella and toxin-producing E. coli infections cause the most sicknesses. Cyclospora is pretty rare.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s is a relatively new pathogen that began appearing in the 1990s,&rdquo; Dr. Jansen said. &ldquo;But, it&rsquo;s been growing.&rdquo;</p><p>Infection from food poisoning can range from mild to debilitating, depending on how much of the germ you swallowed and how healthy your immune system is. Victims suffer cramps, fever, vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea.</p><p>Those symptoms are shared by other illnesses&mdash;like stomach flu.</p><p>So when do you suspect food poisoning? Doctors will look at whether a whole group of people came down with the same symptoms at the same time, Dr. Jansen said.</p><p>Meats and produce are common sources for most types of food poisoning. To avoid it, we cook meat thoroughly and wash fruits and vegetables. Cyclospora&mdash;found most often on imported produce&mdash;is harder to protect against. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You can wash the food and do what you usually do, but washing doesn&rsquo;t always remove it,&rdquo; Dr. Jansen said.</p><p>Cyclospora can also be tricky to diagnose. Patients suspected of food poisoning are not normally screened for that parasite in stool cultures. A specific test must be used. That could explain why some cases were initially misdiagnosed, Dr. Jansen said.</p><p>How do you know if food poisoning is life threatening, or just a mild annoyance? Most people recover on their own a day or two, Dr. Jansen said. But if it hasn&rsquo;t gone away after that, the next step is a doctor&rsquo;s visit and antibiotics.</p><p>If you have intractable nausea and vomiting and can&rsquo;t keep liquids down, bypass your doctor and go straight to the emergency room.</p><p>On the other hand, if you have localized abdominal pain, it could be the sign of a different medical emergency,</p><p>&ldquo;That could be appendicitis or a gallbladder issue,&rdquo; Dr. Jansen said.</p><p><em>If you&rsquo;re experiencing chronic food poisoning symptoms, contact your&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care/locations\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Health primary care physician</em></a><em>.

And most importantly, grieving is normal and there is no timetable for healing.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get over it, but you learn to live through it,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/about-us/spiritual-care/linda-rosengren\" target=\"_blank\">Linda Rosengren, CT, CPLC</a>, chaplain and bereavement services coordinator with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/about-us/spiritual-care\" target=\"_blank\">Spiritual Care</a> for Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. She is certified in perinatal loss care and Thanatology, which includes death education and bereavement counseling.</p><p><strong>Everyone&rsquo;s mourning process is different</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Grief is a normal process. No two people&rsquo;s grief looks the same and no one can say how long grief lasts,&rdquo; added <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/licensed-clinical-social-worker/amy-johnston-lcsw\" target=\"_blank\">Amy N. Johnston</a>, a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) and behavioral health therapist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s personal to each person. Two people in the same family can mourn and grieve very differently. We have to respect each person&rsquo;s process.&rdquo;</p><p>Grief can affect people both physically and psychologically, such as depression, anxiety, stomach pain, loss of appetite, loss of energy and sleep issues.</p><p>While some people may go through phases such as depression, anger, denial and isolation, there is no defined process for each person.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a roller coaster. You are going to have ups and downs and in between during various phases for a period of time,&rdquo; Johnston said.</p><p><strong>Steps to help with healing</strong></p><p>Both Rosengren and Johnston shared some ways to help those who are grieving.</p><ul><li>Be kind and gentle to yourself.</li><li>Allow yourself to feel. Your feelings are valid.</li><li>Take care of your own health.</li><li>Take time for yourself.</li><li>Find a support system, whether it&rsquo;s friends, family or a support group.</li><li>Go for a walk and get fresh air.</li><li>Be sure to get rest.</li><li>Write or draw your thoughts on paper.</li><li>Create a box of memories of your loved one.</li><li>Do yoga or meditation.</li><li>Postpone any life-changing decisions until you feel ready.</li><li>Be patient; &nbsp;it&rsquo;s a process.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;What to do while you&rsquo;re healing is not a one size fits all. These are just an offering of different things people can do,&rdquo; Rosengren said. &ldquo;Just be kind to yourself. Don&rsquo;t think you are going to be the same person you were before you experienced the loss.&rdquo;</p><p>Johnston said a memory box, for example, is helpful for adults and children to be able to remember happier times. It can be an old shoebox which can be personally decorated with photos inside, a journal to write how you are feeling and other mementos. Children may want to put a stuffed animal inside that they can talk to and touch and feel, she said.</p><p>&ldquo;People have a tendency to solely remember the death and not the life when they are grieving and forget to remember the good times. A memory box is a way to stay connected to the person they lost,&rdquo; Johnston said.</p><p>Seeing a doctor or mental health therapist may be helpful, Johnston said, if an individual&rsquo;s grief over the long term becomes overwhelming to the degree that the person can&rsquo;t function in day-to-day life; the anxiety and depression are getting worse, and he or she isn&rsquo;t able to concentrate.</p><p><strong>Finding the words to help</strong></p><p>For friends and family, finding the words to help someone who is grieving can be a challenge.</p><p>&ldquo;I always tell people there is not much we can say. All we can do is to be there to support them and listen to them when they need to talk and be patient with them,&rdquo; &nbsp;Johnston said.</p><p>Be there also for the long term.</p><p>&ldquo;When someone dies, everyone tends to swoop in all at once in the first week or month, but three to six months after and a year after, people are missing,&rdquo; Johnston said. &ldquo;Everyone wants to be there in that moment, but sometime people need their friends and family more in the long term.&rdquo;</p><p>Rosengren added the most important thing friends and family can do is to be present.</p><p>Instead of asking, for example, &ldquo;Let me know what you need or how can I help?&rdquo; it may help to drop off dinner or take the kids for a play date.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes people don&rsquo;t know what they need. Just being available for them is important,&rdquo; Rosengren said.</p><p><strong>Holiday triggers</strong></p><p>Grief will come in waves or triggers such as holidays, anniversaries and birthdays.</p><p>Turning those days into remembrance events can help to honor a loved one, whether it&rsquo;s putting a special ornament on a Christmas tree in their loved one&rsquo;s name, lighting a candle or going to the cemetery.</p><p>Johnston eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every year on her grandmother&rsquo;s birthday, something the two enjoyed eating together.</p><p>&ldquo;It can be as simple as that. It helps in honoring your loved one to remember special times with them. You get to feel that closeness to them again,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Behavioral Health</em></a><em>&nbsp;values the importance of your mental and emotional health providing care for adults and children. &nbsp;A patient coordinator is available at&nbsp;</em><a href=\"tel:1-904-376-3800\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.376.3800</em></a><em>.

More specifically, they may ultimately keep those who need it from seeking care.</p><p>So how does a figure of speech turn into a stigma? <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-george-royal-phd\" target=\"_blank\">George Royal, PhD</a>, a psychologist at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a> and chief of Psychology at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville, said it&rsquo;s all about how those with mental illness perceive themselves, which is affected by how others talk about them.</p><p>&ldquo;One of the things about stigma is that it can categorize how the individual perceives himself or herself, and how others view us. I think people worry more about social stigma than self-stigma. Self-stigma is when the person perceives that he or she will be discriminated against for having emotional issues, like anxiety or depression,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Stigma can increase those problems, because you&rsquo;re afraid to get help &mdash; when you don&rsquo;t want to be criticized by others, you may not seek treatment. Stigma makes a bad problem worse.&rdquo;</p><p>Using diagnostic labels &mdash; everything from crazy and psycho to &ldquo;schizo&rdquo; and more &mdash; is part of that problem. Hearing mental health terms used negatively, even in conversations that aren&rsquo;t meant to be about mental health, can signal to others that mental illness isn&rsquo;t accepted.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with using clinical terminology when it helps define a problem, like schizophrenia, because it&rsquo;s used to help clinicians find and use appropriate treatment strategies,&rdquo; said Dr Royal. &ldquo;I do believe misusing labels lead to misunderstanding, prejudice, embarrassment and stigma. Because of that, I think people avoid seeking mental health services because of embarrassment, and they don&rsquo;t want to be labeled.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Labeling people can hurt</strong></p><p>Misusing labels is not only potentially hurtful bit promotes myths or stereotypes about certain conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) isn&rsquo;t just a preference for cleanliness and order. OCD can interfere with someone&rsquo;s work, school, and relationships by causing repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that lead to anxiety (like aggressive thoughts toward others or fear of germs). Obsessive thoughts lead to compulsions in an attempt to stop the thought, like excessive cleaning or handwashing, counting, and more.</p><p>&ldquo;I very, very rarely have heard people say so-and-so is crazy or psycho. It is much more common for people to say, &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m OCD&rsquo; or, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a little bipolar.&rsquo; They use the diagnostic labels a little more freely, but that is a real problem.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Royal provides the example of mental retardation, which is used to define people with an IQ below 70. It began as a clinical term but was used conversationally as an insult for long enough that now he feels uncomfortable using it even in the clinical sense. It&rsquo;s widely known that the R-word is unacceptable to call others. His example shows that misusing clinical labels can be hurtful, even if a culture doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge it yet.</p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, I often hear diagnostic labels such as bipolar, ADHD and OCD used in a derogatory manner rather than as a descriptive means to obtain mental health services,&rdquo; says Dr. Royal. &ldquo;People use those terms as criticism. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s just so OCD, he has to clean his desk out every day.&rsquo; Or if someone gets angry, someone else might call them &lsquo;bipolar.&rsquo; People view mental health problem as a negative thing. These are very unhelpful things. What they need is support, not criticism or negativity.&rdquo;</p><p>Ultimately, removing diagnostic labels from our vocabulary &mdash; unless we&rsquo;re actually talking about them in a medical sense &mdash; is a small change to make to move the conversation about mental health in a positive direction.</p><p>&ldquo;What I believe is that openness and education about mental health issues are the first steps in promoting understanding,&rdquo; Dr. Royal said. &ldquo;Once the stigma has been alleviated, we have to work on providing readily available access to services, and as we educate people, we can begin to challenge stereotypes and foster greater willingness to seek support.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you or someone you love is concerned about mental health, call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"tel:1-904-376-3800\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.376.3800</em></a><em>&nbsp;to find a Baptist Behavioral Health provider who can help.</em></p>",

One reason, the study said, was that women have less neck strength than men when it comes to heading the ball.

Chastain, 51, told CBS that she has &ldquo;occasional memory lapses.&rdquo; These star athletes are not sure if their lengthy playing careers have put them at a higher risk for brain disease down the road, but both have agreed to posthumously donate their brains to science for further testing.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the first time they are looking at female soccer players &ndash; female brains &ndash; and it&rsquo;s important to have this conversation,&rdquo; Akers told ESPN.com. &ldquo;This needs to be looked at equally for women and men, and until now, it hasn&rsquo;t been.&rdquo;</p><p><em>To learn more about concussions in sports and how to reduce the risk of head injuries, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/orthopedics/sports-medicine\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute&nbsp;</em></a><em>or call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.346.3465</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>When Victoria Cochran signed up for the Donna half-marathon days before her 50th birthday, she wasn&rsquo;t worried about reaching the finish line. A veteran runner, she&rsquo;d done many long-distance races before. But much bigger challenges lay ahead.</p><p>Just weeks after signing up for the annual race, which raises funds for breast cancer, Cochran was diagnosed with the disease. &ldquo;I signed up in October &ndash; which happens to be Breast Cancer Awareness Month &ndash; for a race to beat breast cancer and then I find out I have it myself,&rdquo; she said. Half a month later, her youngest sister was diagnosed as well.</p><p>In Cochran&rsquo;s case, a screening mammogram showed suspicious calcium deposits, and a follow-up screening verified it was cancer. Two weeks later, she had surgery at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center?campaign=Brand&c=4391406506&campaignid=1569221737&adgroupid=54860459210&creativeid=329943924903&matchtype=e&keyword=baptist%20md%20anderson%20cancer%20center%20jacksonville&network=g&adpos=1t1&device=c&devicemodel=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrInPy-mo4wIVg4bACh23KwF0EAAYASAAEgLnovD_BwE\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a> to remove three lumps and a lymph node. After recovering from surgery, she began radiation treatment.</p><p>Most people wouldn&rsquo;t consider running a half-marathon while undergoing radiation, but as race day neared, Cochran felt strong and wanted to run for herself and her sister. &ldquo;I had recovered from my surgery and I was only two weeks into my treatment. I felt good about doing it.&rdquo;</p><p>On race day &ndash; a gloomy, rainy Saturday in February, Cochran got ready for the run, wearing a T-shirt with her sister&rsquo;s name printed on it, as many runners do to honor those fighting the disease or for those who have lost their battle.</p><p>Three miles from the finish line, her normal pace started to slow. Cochran has no memory of what happened, so her running partner and colleague filled her in. &ldquo;I was very tired and told her I needed to sit down,&rdquo; said Cochran.</p><p><strong>Heart-stopping news</strong></p><p>The next thing she knew, she was waking up at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a> a week later feeling very confused.</p><p>Cochran had gone into full cardiac arrest on the half-marathon course. &ldquo;From what I was told, a number of runners stopped to help me. One of them began CPR.&rdquo; When the EMTs arrived, Cochran&rsquo;s heart had to be shocked to restore a normal rhythm and she was rushed to the hospital.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-carl-hassel-md\">David Hassel, MD,</a> a cardiologist with Baptist Heart Specialists, performed a heart catheterization to diagnose the condition and then did surgery to place a stent in Cochran&rsquo;s heart to restore blood flow.</p><p>&ldquo;Victoria&rsquo;s condition is called spontaneous coronary artery dissection, or SCAD,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-marc-litt-md\">Marc Litt, MD,&nbsp;</a>one of Cochran&rsquo;s cardiologists at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\">Baptist Heart Specialists.</a> &ldquo;It happens when there is a tear in the lining of a blood vessel to the heart, creating a clot that prevents blood flow to the heart.</p><p>&ldquo;SCAD is rare, and usually affects healthy, active women with no signs of heart disease, like Victoria,&rdquo; Dr. Litt said. &ldquo;Unlike most heart attacks, which are usually caused by atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in an artery), a person experiencing SCAD doesn&rsquo;t have this.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Litt doesn&rsquo;t think running or breast cancer treatment caused the heart attack. &ldquo;SCAD&rsquo;s a spontaneous condition and the causes are still unknown,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Cochran wasn&rsquo;t aware of any symptoms leading up to her cardiac arrest, but the signs are the same as those of a normal heart attack, which include:</p><ul><li>Uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain in the center of your chest. It may last more than a few minutes, or goes away and comes back.</li><li>Pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach.</li><li>Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort.</li><li>Breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness.</li></ul><p>As with men, women&rsquo;s most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort. But women are more likely to experience shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain.</p><p><strong>Being part of the solution</strong></p><p>It is theorized that there may be a genetic component linked to SCAD. Cochran was referred to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for further evaluation, which confirmed the heart attack was caused by SCAD. Since then, Cochran has &ldquo;signed over her DNA&rdquo; to be part of both a Vanderbilt and Harvard University study to determine the causes of SCAD and if genetics play a role.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;I am hoping that over time, there will be a breakthrough. I am glad I can play a role in determining the cause of this rare condition,&rdquo; Cochran said.</p><p>She is now a big believer in understanding your risk factors and family disease history. As a result, her family has had genetic testing to determine their cancer risk.</p><p>Now, cancer-free with a normally functioning heart, Cochran has been cleared to run up to three miles. She was able to return to work just two weeks after her heart attack and completed the remainder of her radiation treatments at Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p><p>Cochran reflects back on her experience and remarkable recovery to make sense of all she&rsquo;s been through.</p><p>&ldquo;There were so many odd coincidences,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not only was I diagnosed with breast cancer during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, but I also had my heart attack in February, which is Heart Month. And my sister being diagnosed so soon after I was.&rdquo; (Her sister&rsquo;s prognosis is good.)</p><p>Having survived two life-threatening conditions has made Cochran pay special attention to what her life has in store and how she can give back. As a talent development professional, she wants to expand her reach in helping others to grow academically and professionally.</p><p>&ldquo;Clearly, it wasn&rsquo;t my time,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>In addition to understanding your genetic history, Cochran stresses to others the importance of getting regular mammograms and taking care of yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel an immense amount of gratitude for my health care providers, my family, friends, colleagues, and the community. The outpouring of support was truly amazing. &nbsp;I received get-well cards from people I didn&rsquo;t even know. It&rsquo;s a constant reminder to me of how wonderful people are and how blessed I am.&rdquo;</p><p>She&rsquo;s also grateful that her heart attack happened during a race, where so many came to her aid and a runner was able to give her CPR.&nbsp;</p><p>Cochran was recently surprised by local celebrity Donna Deegan, founder of the Donna Run and three-time breast cancer survivor, who presented her with a commemorative finisher medal from the race.</p><p>The experience certainly hasn&rsquo;t dampened her desire to continue reaching finish lines. &ldquo;I plan to run the same race next year,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And reach the finish line.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Primary care physicians are often the first to recognize changes that could lead to serious health conditions.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>For many couples, raising a family is a top priority, one that is usually agreed upon long before a baby arrives. Being on the same page regarding goals and dreams is important, too, especially when it comes to adding children to the mix. While parenting is a hugely rewarding and satisfying experience, relationships can shift over time to accommodate the needs of the kids. And as the focus shifts towards the children and away from each other, it can cast a shadow on the main relationship that started it all. What&rsquo;s a busy couple to do?</p><p><strong>Communicate</strong></p><p>Whether it&rsquo;s a new baby or a busy pre-teen or teenager who absorbs your attention, raising children is hard work! Adding a new member to the family is an even bigger adjustment. Research shows that most couples undergo a decline in satisfaction with their relationship once a new baby joins the family. With the combination of the added responsibility, stress and sleep deprivation involved in caring for an infant, it&rsquo;s no wonder that both partners not only need time to adapt to the new dynamic but sometimes experience feelings of animosity if there isn&rsquo;t healthy communication.</p><p>&ldquo;It can be easy to hold feelings of anger and resentment, for example, if one partner feels that the heavier part of the load is on them,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/julia-garrett-psyd\" target=\"_blank\">Julia &ldquo;Jill&rdquo; Garrett, PsyD</a>, a licensed clinical psychologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>, whose areas of expertise include adjustment and phase-of-life issues, stress management, and maternal mental health. &ldquo;Couples have to remind themselves that they are both undergoing major changes with the arrival of a new child or even having other children at home and that they need to work hard to communicate and relate to each other.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1563801573/Juice/GettyImages-596795656JUICE2nd.jpg\" alt=\"Couple\"></div><p>When you&rsquo;re co-parenting a child of any age, don&rsquo;t start a conversation by placing blame with &ldquo;you are&rdquo; statements, as in, &ldquo;You are not doing anything around here,&rdquo; Dr. Garrett recommended. Instead, use &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements as a way to own your feelings while letting your partner know what kind of support you need.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more effective to say, &lsquo;I am feeling overwhelmed. Would you feed the baby tonight or give our toddler a bath so I can get some extra sleep or some alone time?&rsquo;&rdquo; she said.</p><p><strong>Share the responsibilities</strong></p><p>Teamwork is imperative. Divide up the most important chores and if some don&rsquo;t get done, it&rsquo;s OK to let them slide.</p><p>&ldquo;Increasing responsibilities and delegating kid-related tasks and household chores can be a point of contention for many parents,&rdquo; said Dr. Garrett. &ldquo;Consider a weekly check-in with your partner to discuss any possible shifts in routine and/or recent difficulties that have arisen. But make sure you schedule the check-ins during times when you&rsquo;re well-rested and things are relatively stress-free.&rdquo;</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve just had a baby, it&rsquo;s important to know that around 80 percent of new mothers experience some form of &ldquo;baby blues&rdquo; in the first two-to-three weeks after giving birth. The fact that around 20 percent of women experience ongoing Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs), and that 10 percent of men also experience post-partum mood-related difficulties, adds to an already challenging adjustment. Do your best to offer each other support and compassion, and if emotional symptoms persist or begin to interfere with daily life and/or impact your relationship, don&rsquo;t be afraid to reach out to a health care professional for more support.</p><p><strong>Stay connected, avoid the divide</strong></p><p>When a new baby comes home, one partner can feel left out, especially if mom is breastfeeding and bonding with the new baby. The other partner often feels pushed out with this new family dynamic, said Josephine Moss, MS, LMFT, a licensed marriage and family therapist. Adapting to such a lifestyle transition can be difficult, and one partner can sometimes feel excluded and forgotten, which can lead to looking outside the relationship for validation. Staying connected from the beginning and through the years as kids grow and more come along is the key to staying on track. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really about being intentional and mindful about your life and your relationship,&rdquo; Moss said. &ldquo;In the blink of an eye, your 30s can just fly by when it&rsquo;s all about the kids. You have to say, &lsquo;Wait! Us!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Growing apart while kids are growing up is such a common thing, so you have to make the effort to develop a lifestyle that incorporates a healthy balance of time with the children and time with your partner, too, she said. Date nights, alone vacations and, more importantly, taking time each day to connect on an emotional, intimate level by talking about your needs, your struggles, and your fears, is extremely important. Dedicating your entire self to your kids and ignoring your needs and that of your partner&rsquo;s will, in time, leave you with less in common, and a great divide that becomes too far to cross.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be with your partner longer than you are going to be raising little ones so it&rsquo;s vital to spend time nurturing that relationship,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Our culture is so focused on putting the kids first, but the relationship sustains the family. If you don&rsquo;t nurture it, everything else just falls apart.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Baptist Health offers a variety of resources including classes, programs and support groups for parents, which you can find at&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/patient-info/classes-and-events\" target=\"_blank\"><em>BaptistJax.com</em></a><em>.

You sit and wait on the toilet day after day, but nothing or barely anything happens.</p><p>You&rsquo;re constipated, and also quite miserable.</p><p>But there are ways to help you find relief from chronic constipation, whether it&rsquo;s changing your diet, taking over-the-counter medication, prescription medicine or exercising. And, there are steps to take to keep from getting stopped up in the first place.</p><p>Constipation generally means you&rsquo;ve had:</p><ul><li>Three or fewer bowel movements in a week</li><li>Straining</li><li>Lumpy or hard stools that are difficult to pass</li><li>Feeling that you are not finished</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Constipation can cause abdominal pain, bloating, cramps, decreased appetite and fatigue,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/internist/dr-jami-feltner-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jami Feltner, MD</a>, an internist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a>. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Input may impact output</strong></p><p>What you eat and drink, or what you don&rsquo;t could be culprits. Constipation can be caused by:</p><ul><li>Poor diet (eating too much meat and dairy products and processed foods high in fat and sugar)</li><li>Not eating enough high-fiber food</li><li>Lack of water and other fluids</li><li>Consuming too much alcohol and/or caffeine</li></ul><p>Not exercising enough or having an inactive lifestyle can also cause problems with your bathroom routine. Exercising helps keep your bowels moving.</p><p>In addition, using certain medications (pain medicine, antidepressants, diuretics, calcium supplement), and even depression and anxiety, can be factors too.</p><p>In most cases, changing your diet and lifestyle can improve regularity. But if that doesn&rsquo;t help and the problems persist, seeing a doctor is important.</p><p>Constipation can cause hemorrhoids, anal fissures (tear in your skin), rectal prolapse (when the rectum protrudes because of straining) and fecal impaction (when stool becomes stuck in your colon or rectum), all serious conditions.</p><p>&ldquo;Occasional constipation can be normal, but rarely, more serious medical conditions and/or medications can be the cause,&rdquo; said Dr. Feltner said.</p><p>Secondary causes of chronic constipation could be from endocrine/metabolic disorders (thyroid, diabetes or pregnancy), neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis or Parkinson&rsquo;s disease) and structural issues (bowel obstruction or cancer).</p><p>In addition to drinking plenty of water and exercising, some ways to avoid constipation include:</p><ul><li>Consuming 25 to 35 grams of fiber daily, including fruits, vegetables and whole grains with every meal</li><li>Managing your stress</li><li>Establishing a regular daily bathroom time and going as soon as there is the urge</li></ul><p>If dietary changes or lifestyle modifications don&rsquo;t help, consider laxatives, including stool softeners, that make it easier to go.</p><p>Bulk-forming laxatives including Metamucil&reg;, Citrucel&reg;, FiberCon&reg; or Benefiber&reg; also help by absorbing water, softening stool and increasing stool mass, Dr. Feltner said. Osmotic laxatives (such as MiraLAX&reg;) work by increasing the water content in your intestine.</p><p>Due to possible adverse effects, Dr. Feltner added that stimulant laxatives such as Dulcolax&reg; or Senokot&reg; should only be used if other laxatives were not successful. For severe chronic constipation, your physician may prescribe another medication.</p><p>&ldquo;Always talk to your doctor before starting any medication or supplement and with any alarm symptoms such as blood in your stool, recent unexplained weight loss, a family history of bowel disease/cancer, or change in the shape of your stool,&rdquo; Dr. Feltner said. &ldquo;If you are still suffering from constipation after trying dietary changes, exercise and over-the-counter remedies, it may be time to see your doctor to rule out other medical conditions.&rdquo;</p><p><em>To find the right primary care doctor for you or your loved one, call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Primary Care</em></a><em>&nbsp;at </em><a href=\"tel:1-904-202-4968\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.202.4YOU</em></a><em> (4968).

Do you often find excuses to avoid going out to eat with friends and family for fear of how your stomach will react?</p><p>You may have heard of these conditions if you have stomach or colon problems: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). They are similar in nature in that they both cause stomach pain, abdominal cramping, bloating, diarrhea or constipation, and can be tricky to diagnose. But they do have distinct differences as well.</p><p>Take IBS. Often called spastic colon, this condition is commonly seen by primary care physicians and gastroenterologists, with about 10 to 15% of the population experiencing IBS symptoms.</p><p><strong>Making a diagnosis</strong></p><p>Sometimes a person may be initially diagnosed with IBS, but it&rsquo;s later determined through a colonoscopy or endoscopy (exams that view the colon and gastrointestinal tract) and other imaging studies that they actually have IBD.</p><p>IBD includes two very serious GI conditions: &nbsp;Crohn&rsquo;s disease and ulcerative colitis. Both result in chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and can cause tissue damage. Crohn&rsquo;s often affects different areas throughout the intestinal tract while ulcerative colitis is generally found in the large intestine and rectum.</p><p>About 1.3%, or 3 million adults in the U.S., were diagnosed with IBD in 2015.</p><p><strong>IBD red flags</strong></p><p>Some red flags people should watch out for with IBD, include:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Persistent diarrhea</li><li>Blood in your stools or black stools</li><li>Weight loss or loss of appetite</li><li>Progressively worsening symptoms</li><li>Fatigue</li></ul><p>IBD requires ongoing treatment and monitoring. Severe IBD may also require surgery.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;IBD is more concerning because it is a disease of the gastrointestinal tract,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-patricia-calhoun-md\" target=\"_blank\">Patricia McFall Calhoun, MD</a>, a family physician with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a>. &ldquo;It can take a while to diagnose. &nbsp;If your symptoms are not getting better, it&rsquo;s important to be diligent and follow up with your physician for further testing or referral to a gastroenterologist.&rdquo;</p><p>Also, she added, &ldquo;IBD is definitely more concerning because it increases the risk for colon cancer.</p><p>Dr. Calhoun will generally order blood work and stool tests to help in the diagnosis. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adjusting your diet</strong></p><p>Steps that can help with IBS include:</p><ul><li>Trying an elimination diet to determine if specific foods aggravate symptoms</li><li>Taking probiotics</li><li>Testing gluten-free products</li><li>Using adequate fiber in your diet</li><li>Avoiding gas-inducing foods such as beans</li></ul><p>&ldquo;A heart-healthy diet with regular exercise and adequate sleep are vital components to disease prevention and continued wellness,&rdquo; Dr. Calhoun said. &ldquo;Inadequate sleep can also cause you to experience more stress, which can definitely aggravate IBS symptoms.&rdquo;</p><p>Stress, anxiety and depression can contribute to IBS. Antispasmodic medications, on the other hand, are used to reduce intestinal spasms and may help alleviate symptoms.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;These conditions can impact a person&rsquo;s ability to eat out or perform their regular routines because of a constant fear that their GI symptoms may flare up at any time,&rdquo; Dr. Calhoun said. &ldquo;Both IBS and IBD can be distracting because people are worried about what their stomach is doing instead of attending to what they need to at the time.

There&rsquo;s no better way to cool down than taking a dip in a sparkling pool.</p><p>But you should be cautious, especially in community pools. That&rsquo;s because what&rsquo;s lurking in the water that you don&rsquo;t see could make you or your child sick.</p><p>An increase in a fecal parasite commonly found in community pools is on the rise, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Cryptosporidium, also known as crypto, is the main cause of outbreaks of diarrhea linked to water. One diarrheal incident in the water can release millions of diarrhea-causing germs like crypto, E. coli, norovirus and others.</p><p>From 2009 to 2017, there were 444 cryptosporidiosis outbreaks, resulting in 7,465 cases reported by 40 states and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC. The number of reported outbreaks has increased an average of about 13% per year, with swallowing contaminated water in pools or water playgrounds as one of the main causes.</p><p>Chlorine is not as effective at killing the cryptovirus, allowing it to easily spread to others. That&rsquo;s why people need to be diligent especially when using community pools, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatrician/dr-mark-bedard-do\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Bedard, DO</a>, a pediatrician with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care/Orange Park Pediatrics</a>. Crypto is reported to be able to survive in properly chlorinated water for more than seven days.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s harder to treat and eliminate from a pool and can spread rapidly through a community,&rdquo; Dr. Bedard said. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have a good immune system, you can really get sick.&rdquo;</p><p>What prevention steps can you or your child take?</p><ul><li>Avoid swallowing or getting water in your mouth.</li><li>Rinse off before going into the pool.</li><li>Shower with soap and water when getting out of the pool either on-site or when you get home.</li><li>Keep out of the water if you have diarrhea or vomiting symptoms.</li><li>If diarrhea or a bowel movement occurs while in the water, notify pool authorities.</li><li>Put infants in special swim diapers, which minimize leakage.</li><li>Take children on bathroom breaks and check diapers often.</li><li>Change diapers in a bathroom, not at the pool.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;It takes a community effort to try to eliminate these types of issues so it&rsquo;s important to notify the proper people who can clean the pool and take the appropriate precautions,&rdquo; Dr. Bedard said. &ldquo;You have to look out for everyone, not just yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>Symptoms if you do get sick may include:</p><ul><li>Abdominal pain and cramping</li><li>Fever</li><li>Profuse diarrhea</li></ul><p>While a regular stomach bug may last a couple of days, crypto symptoms are more severe. Depending on the symptoms and how long they last, medication may be prescribed by a physician.</p><p>People should also be cautious of hot tubs, which are harder to keep clean because chlorine doesn&rsquo;t last as long, Dr. Bedard said.</p><p>&ldquo;People are sitting in a small heated space that can get pretty dirty,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Children under 12 should avoid hot tubs altogether.</p><p>Other precaution when in the heat, include:</p><ul><li>Stay hydrated, drinking eight cups of water a day. If you are sweating, try a sports drink that replaces lost electrolytes.</li><li>Apply at least 30 SPF sunscreen every 30 minutes or at least hourly based on skin tone.</li><li>Use earplugs and over-the-counter swimmer&rsquo;s ear drops when getting out of the pool, which helps pull water out of the ear to prevent infection.</li><li>Avoid lakes and ponds if you have a cut.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;We want children to be outside, swimming and having fun.

Even in cooler months, temps can quickly rise 50 degrees higher than outside.</p><p>So how do hot car deaths happen? More than half are due to forgetfulness. We&rsquo;ve all heard stories where a well-meaning parent forgets a child is in the back seat, usually because this is a break from their normal routine.</p><p>Other accidents occur because an adult mistakenly thinks it&rsquo;s safe to leave a little one in a hot car for a minute to quickly run into a store. But in actuality, leaving a child in a hot car could lead to heatstroke in just 10 minutes.</p><p>In some cases, people forget to lock their vehicles and a young child gains access on their own.</p><p>&ldquo;No matter what, <strong>never leave a child or pet unattended inside a hot car</strong> -- even if the windows are cracked or the car is parked in the shade,&rdquo; said Cynthia Dennis, RN, coordinator, Safe Kids Northeast Florida, led by THE PLAYERS Center for Child Health. &ldquo;And always remember to lock your vehicle to keep a child from getting inside.&rdquo; To prevent hot car deaths, Dennis recommends remembering to &ldquo;ACT&rdquo; -- avoid injury, create reminders, and take action:</p><p><strong>A</strong> &ndash; Avoid Injury. Avoid heatstroke-related injury and death by never leaving your child alone in a car, not even for a minute. Also, remember to make sure your car doors are locked when you aren&rsquo;t in your vehicle to keep kids from getting in on their own.</p><p><strong>C</strong> &ndash; Create reminders. If it&rsquo;s not your usual routine to have a child in the car with you, create a reminder by putting something in the back of your car next to your child such as a briefcase, a purse or a cell phone that is needed at your final destination. This is especially important if you&rsquo;re not following your normal routine.</p><p><strong>T</strong> - Take action. If you see a child alone in a car, call 911. Emergency personnel wants you to call! One call could save a life.</p><p>Other tips to prevent leaving a child in a hot car, according to Dennis, include:</p><ul><li>If you drive with your right foot, leave your left shoe in the backseat next to your child or pet.</li><li>Make it a habit to look in the back seat before closing and locking the doors</li><li>Set an alarm with a different ringtone to remind you that you have a child with you.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><em>For more tips, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.com/safekids\"><em>wolfsonchildrens.com/safekids</em></a></p>",

The procedure involves creating small holes in the skull to implant electrodes that connect to a pacemaker-like device in the chest.</p><p>Deep brain stimulation is an established treatment for people with movement disorders, such as essential tremor, an inherited condition that Bevan has in both hands.</p><p>The final straw came last summer when he fell in his kitchen and couldn&rsquo;t pull himself up. Fortunately, he was able to call 911 from a nearby phone.</p><p>&ldquo;When I fell, I also hit my head, so they decided I needed a CT scan,&rdquo; said Bevan, who also underwent a lumbar scan known as a cisternogram to examine spinal fluid flow surrounding his spinal cord.</p><p>Both the CT and the cisternogram suggested NPH. When Linda heard the diagnosis, she immediately researched NPH on her computer. &ldquo;I told Ken, &lsquo;This is good news because it&rsquo;s treatable,&rsquo;&rdquo; she recalled.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Wallace\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1562765284/Juice/brad-wallace-md-p2017.jpg\"></div><p>After making appointments with four different neurosurgeons, including two out of state, the couple decided to stay close to home after meeting Baptist Lyerly neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-bradley-wallace-md\" target=\"_blank\">Brad Wallace</a>, MD, PhD.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Wallace said he has a knack for doing this kind of surgery, and that&rsquo;s what really sold us,&rdquo; said Bevan, who moved to St. Augustine in 2009 after practicing law in the Orlando area for more than 40 years. &ldquo;After we walked out of his office, I turned to Linda and said, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s our man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>According to Dr. Wallace, NPH is the most common form of dementia and the only one that is surgically treatable. &quot;I probably treat two or three people a month with NPH. It&#39;s essentially a plumbing problem in the brain. To be a candidate for surgery, you have to have enlarged fluid chambers or ventricles that show up on imaging.&quot;</p><p><strong>YouTube moment</strong></p><p>NPH surgery involves surgical placement of a shunt that diverts cerebral spinal fluid from the brain to another part of the body, usually the lower part of the abdomen. The shunt remains in the person&rsquo;s body for the rest of his or her life and can be adjusted periodically to keep the fluid flowing in the right direction and at the correct rate.</p><p>&quot;As long as the shunt is functional, it serves as a cure for NPH,&quot; Dr. Wallace said. &quot;The classic symptoms of NPH are memory problems, a shuffling gait and urinary incontinence. If you have at least two of these, you should probably consider having an MRI or CT scan of the head to confirm the diagnosis.&quot;</p><p>Bevan had surgery on Nov. 9, 2018, and spent five days at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>, followed by two days in a rehab facility.</p><p>Like many NPH patients, he didn&rsquo;t experience immediate improvement. &ldquo;It was one step forward, and one step back,&rdquo; said Linda. &ldquo;He progressed from a walker to a cane and to walking without aid. But even when he was using the walker, I noticed that his gait was so much better.&rdquo;</p><p>The only telltale sign that Bevan had neurosurgery is a tiny scar where he parts his hair. Since the surgery, his essential tremor has improved.</p><p>One day while listening to music on YouTube, Bevan asked his wife if she would dance with him in their living room. Linda worried that her husband of nearly 50 years might fall. But Ken told her, lovingly, &ldquo;If I do, I won&rsquo;t fall far.&rdquo;</p><p>Before departing for Scotland in April, Linda shared Ken&rsquo;s NPH journey in a Facebook post with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health</a>. &ldquo;We were chasing a diagnosis for almost 10 years. My husband had such a horrible gait, it seemed like he was marching in place,&rdquo; the post said. &ldquo;Now, he walks perfectly normal. Please pass this on to Dr. Wallace.&rdquo;</p><p><em>To learn how to treat other movement disorders, visit Baptist Lyerly Neurosurgery or call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.202.2273</em></a><em>. &nbsp;</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Summertime and playtime go hand in hand but, unfortunately, so do increased accidents and injuries. In fact, across the U.S., emergency rooms see a 15-27% rise during the summer months. Here are some ways to prevent a trip to the ER.</p><p><strong>Head off injuries</strong></p><p>Whether it&#39;s rollerblading, biking, skateboarding or riding a scooter, wearing a helmet is the way to go. For kids under 16, wearing a helmet is the law. A helmet should fit comfortably and not too tightly with straps fastened. Look for one that is certified by the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC).</p><p><strong>Know the rules of the road</strong></p><p>Make sure your children know the rules of the road when they&rsquo;re out riding bikes, including riding on the right side of the road, knowing the proper hand signals, and never wearing headphones while cycling.</p><p><strong>Stretch before play</strong></p><p>Most adults know that stretching is important but forget to pass that wisdom along to their kiddos. Make sure children properly warm up and stretch before outdoor sports and activities. Stretching helps prevent muscle tears or sprains, especially as kids move from one activity to the next. Also, have them stretch after activities, which can reduce the risk of injuries.</p><p><strong>Jump for joy</strong></p><p>Trampolines should always be fully enclosed with netting, located away from concrete surfaces, and the springs should be permanently covered to prevent getting caught in them. Be sure to supervise children while they are jumping. One jumper at a time will prevent collisions.</p><p><strong>Fuel up with fresh food</strong></p><p>Increased heat leads to more food-borne illnesses during the summer months. Food that has been left out of the refrigerator for more than one hour should not be eaten. This is especially true for items made with mayonnaise, eggs, and milk, as well as poultry, seafood, and meat, which are a major source of food poisoning.</p><p><em>If you need emergency medical attention, Baptist Health has seven <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-emergency-rooms\">emergency centers</a> open 24/7 for children and adults.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>One in four adults over age 65 experience a fall each year, resulting in about 3 million visits to the emergency room. Former President Jimmy Carter, who broke his hip in May following a fall, is just one example. Many of the falls result in a hospitalization, primarily due to head injuries or hip fractures, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Even more concerning, some studies point to 30 percent of people dying within a year of a hip fracture if they&rsquo;re over age 65.</p><p>But there are ways to decrease those odds by trying to prevent the falls in the first place; ensuring your body is strong enough to handle a fall and seeking medical assistance as soon as possible.</p><p>&ldquo;Getting patients in more quickly, within 48 hours after injury, has been shown to increase the lifespan,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/orthopedic-surgeon/dr-brett-frykberg-md\" target=\"_blank\">Brett Frykberg, MD</a>, orthopedic surgeon with Baptist Health and <a href=\"https://www.joionline.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</a>, who has seen survival rates improve in recent years.</p><p>New surgical techniques that decrease operational time and blood loss, combined with starting physical therapy as soon as possible after surgery, has also enhanced recovery.</p><p>&ldquo;Advancements have not only helped the patient during surgery but have helped reduce complications after surgery as the patient recovers,&rdquo; Dr. Frykberg said.</p><p><strong>Weaker bones increase fall risk</strong></p><p>Older adults and people with renal disease and osteoporosis, a bone disease which causes a loss in the amount of bone tissue in your bones, have a higher risk of breaking a hip because of weaker bones. Falls can also be contributed to vision or cognitive impairment.</p><p>&ldquo;The older we are, the more likely we are to have osteoporosis and weak bones,&rdquo; Dr. Frykberg said. &ldquo;Older persons who have surgery are also at higher risk of pneumonia, for example, because of stress on the heart and lungs, which complicates recovery.&rdquo;</p><p>But steps can be taken to improve chances of recovery and improve falling in the first place, including:</p><ul><li>Stay active and stay healthy</li><li>Don&rsquo;t sit for long periods of time</li><li>Maintain a normal blood pressure</li><li>Take calcium and Vitamin D on a daily basis if you are over the age of 40 to help prevent osteoporosis</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Vitamin supplements are extremely important,&rdquo; Dr. Frykberg said. &ldquo;Low-impact exercises like walking or riding a stationary bike increase the heart rate and are both good for heart health as well as bone and joint strength. Staying active, in general, has been shown to prolong life.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>More women than men impacted&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Dr. Frykberg said hip fractures happen more commonly in women because of the higher incidence of osteoporosis.</p><p>Statistics show one in two women and up to one in four men over the age of 50 will break a bone due to osteoporosis, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. By 2020, one in two Americans over 50 are expected to have or be at risk of developing osteoporosis of the hip.</p><p>The good news is there are many new treatment options when dealing with a fractured hip.</p><p>Though not always used with hip fractures, robotic surgery can provide more precise placement of implants. Newer techniques such as approaches that spare more muscle combined with rehab soon after surgery have patients walking more quickly.</p><p>Depending on where the fracture is, surgery may or may not be needed. If surgery is needed, physical therapy generally starts the same day or the next day if the surgery was at night. Some fractures can be fixed with screws or partial hip replacement.</p><p><em>If you are experiencing hip pain, there are various procedures and treatments available by Baptist Health and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.joionline.net/hip-surgery/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</em></a><em>&nbsp;depending on the severity of your discomfort.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Nothing says summertime like the smell of burgers on the grill. Before you fire up, be sure to follow these safety tips:</p><p><strong>Make sure your grill is in good working order.</strong> If you&rsquo;re using a propane grill, check the connections between the propane tank hose and the grill. Then, check for gas leaks. You can do this by turning the propane tank on and applying a small amount of soapy water to the hose. If there are bubbles around the hose, you have a gas leak. Turn off the tank and burners immediately and get the grill serviced before using it again. If the leak doesn&rsquo;t stop, or if you smell gas while grilling, turn it off and call the fire department.</p><p><strong>Kickin&rsquo; it old school with charcoal?</strong> Charcoal grills create a wonderful smoky flavor and are a lot more portable. Use only charcoal starter fluid and never add starter fluid when the coals have already been ignited. After grilling, be sure to let the coals cool completely before throwing away the ashes. And no matter what type of grill you use, make sure children and pets are kept a safe distance away.</p><p><strong>Keep your grill clean.</strong> Always remember to clean your grill after your done cooking. This ensures that bacteria are kept away from your food as well prevents flare-ups. Allowing grease and fat to build up adds more fuel for fire as it is a major source of flare-ups.</p><p><strong>Never leave your grill unattended.</strong> Anything can happen. Fires tend to double in size every minute. It&rsquo;s best to plan ahead, do all of your food prep before firing up the grill. Remember to keep a fire extinguisher nearby in case of an emergency.</p><p><strong>Remember to grill 10 feet away from your home.</strong> At least 10 feet is great, but even farther away is better. Never grill underneath wooden overhangs either, as this could cause a flare-up. Also, remember to pay attention to any overhanging tree branches when setting up your grill.</p><p><em>If you experience a severe burn, go to your closest emergency department.

According to a recently released survey by the Jacksonville Nonprofit Hospital Partnership, 64 percent of survey respondents said mental health and mental health conditions top the list of 14 pressing community health needs. Cancer, by the way, ranked sixth.</p><p>To address this pressing need, the five-hospital partnership, which includes <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health</a>, came up with a goal in 2016 to train 10,000 members of our community in <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Mental Health First Aid&nbsp;</a>by 2020.</p><p>Mental Health First Aid is a free, eight-hour training course that teaches participants how to identify, communicate with and connect people suffering with mental health issues to local resources.</p><p>I recently took the training at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-beaches\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Beaches&nbsp;</a>and I&rsquo;m officially certified by the National Council for Behavioral Health for three years. I have a certificate to prove it.</p><p>Mental Health First Aid was created in 2000 by Betty Kitchener, a nurse specializing in health education, and her husband, a college professor. Realizing the lack of understanding of mental health issues in their community, the couple came up with a first-responder-style course that trains everyday people in how to recognize and help others suffering with a mental health problem or crisis.</p><p>Today, Mental Health First Aid classes are taught in more than 20 countries, including the U.S., where more than 1.5 million Americans have been trained.</p><p>My top takeaways from the training were:</p><ul><li>Make a person experiencing a mental health issue feel respected, accepted and understood</li><li>Listen non-judgmentally to what they have to say</li><li>Encourage them to seek help</li></ul><p>Our instructor, Katrina Robinson-Wheeler, a licensed mental health worker, said she has trained nearly 3,000 people in Mental Health First Aid since 2016. She is also certified to teach Mental Health First Aid to police officers and firefighters.</p><p>Like any first-aid course, we learned an action plan using the mnemonic ALGEE&reg;, which stands for:</p><ul><li>Assess for risk of suicide or harm</li><li>Listen nonjudgmentally</li><li>Give reassurance and information</li><li>Encourage appropriate professional help</li><li>Encourage self-help and other support strategies</li></ul><p>The second thing we learned was how to apply the action plan to a number of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, substance-use disorders, eating disorders and psychosis.</p><p>The latter was of particular interest to me because a member of my family has suffered from schizophrenia for decades.</p><p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve learned not to offer counsel because that&rsquo;s for the experts. Instead, it&rsquo;s important to listen attentively and sympathetically to what a person with a mental illness has to say and accept the illness for what it is &ndash; a disability that is not going away.</p><p>Enrolling in Mental Health First Aid was another way for me to further educate myself about his disease. If I learned anything from the course, it was to be even more of an empathic listener.</p><p>Said Rachel Naomi Remen, a clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco: &ldquo;A loving silence often has far more power to heal and to connect than the most well-intentioned words.&rdquo;</p><p>Baptist Health, along with other area nonprofit hospitals, is offering free Mental Health First Aid training to residents throughout the Jacksonville area.

For one Crawfordville, &nbsp;Fla., mother, that memorable day was the day her son had emergency brain surgery.</p><p>March 14, 2019.</p><p>Up until that Thursday afternoon, Amy Atkins described her son Ethan as a typical teenager. The 15-year-old Wakulla High School sophomore loves duck hunting with his brother and spending time on the family boat. But on March 14, a single text from Ethan&rsquo;s older brother, Kaleb, sent a wave crashing onto the family.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom, you need to come home,&rdquo; the text message read.</p><p>Atkins called Kaleb and heard terror and urgency in his voice. &ldquo;Ethan is having trouble walking,&rdquo; Kaleb told his mother.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; Atkins said. &ldquo;Everything had been perfectly fine when Ethan left for school that morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Atkins left work immediately and took Ethan to a local urgent care facility. Ethan was having weakness in his right leg and difficulty walking. While they were waiting to be seen, Ethan had a focal seizure, limited to his right leg. The urgent care medical team called for an ambulance and had Ethan transported to the Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/locations/tallahassee-er\" target=\"_blank\">Emergency Center</a> &ndash; Northeast.</p><p>At the Emergency Center &ndash; Northeast, Ethan was examined by emergency physician Gregory Peters, MD. Dr. Peters ordered a CT scan.</p><p>&ldquo;We frequently see patients present with first-time seizures, but they are usually generalized, suggesting there is not a focal lesion,&rdquo; commented Dr. Peters. &ldquo;Ethan&#39;s seizures involved just his right leg, suggesting a lesion in the left brain, which, unfortunately, is what we found on CT imaging.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Peters then consulted with Narlin Beaty, MD, neurosurgeon with Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare (TMH) and Tallahassee Neurological Clinic (TNC). The CT scan confirmed Ethan had a brain lesion and his life depended on brain surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Peters told us our son had a mass on his brain,&rdquo; Amy Atkins said. &ldquo;He showed us on the computer screen that he had what appeared to be a golf ball-sized tumor.&rdquo;</p><p>After consulting with Dr. Peters, Dr. Beaty recommended Ethan be examined by a specialized pediatric neurosurgeon.</p><p>&ldquo;I am grateful to have a strong, ongoing relationship with the neuro team at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Dr. Beaty. &ldquo;Having this partnership, which allows us to conveniently consult with and transfer patients to their very specialized pediatric physicians and staff, makes us a stronger health care system overall.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Beaty reached out to his pediatric neurosurgery colleague at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville, <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-neurosurgeon/dr-nathan-ranalli-md\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Ranalli, MD</a>. Dr. Ranalli is with the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/brain\" target=\"_blank\">Stys Neuroscience Institute</a> at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, which provides comprehensive pediatric neurological and neurosurgical treatment and care to children of all ages from North Florida, South Georgia and beyond. The relationship between TMH and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s helped facilitate rapid coordination of care for Ethan, who was transferred from TMH to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s with his mom by his side.</p><p>&ldquo;Before Ethan arrived, Dr. Beaty sent me Ethan&rsquo;s CT scan and notified the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/emergency\" target=\"_blank\">emergency department</a> at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Dr. Ranalli, who is also an assistant professor in the Division of Pediatric Neurosurgery at the UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville. &ldquo;Dr. Beaty and I discussed Ethan&rsquo;s sudden onset of a seizure and weakness in his right leg in an otherwise healthy teen.&rdquo;</p><p>When they arrived, they were met by Dr. Ranalli and the medical team at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. &ldquo;When the ambulance door opened, the doctors were ready and waiting to take care of my son,&rdquo; said Amy.</p><p>Dr. Ranalli ordered an MRI, which showed that Ethan had a large vascular lesion on the front left side of his brain. In medical terms, Ethan had a rare condition called a cavernous malformation or cavernoma, an abnormal collection of blood vessels in the brain. A portion of the large mass had ruptured and was producing pressure on the part of Ethan&rsquo;s brain responsible for movement on the right side of his body, and the cause of his seizure and the weakness in his right leg.</p><p>Because of the cavernoma&rsquo;s size and the sudden onset of symptoms, Dr. Ranalli recommended Ethan have surgery immediately to remove the mass. In the operating room, Dr. Ranalli used a stealth navigation system that is integrated with sophisticated imaging equipment to precisely locate the lesion and completely remove it. The procedure took approximately four hours.</p><p>&ldquo;Fortunately, the cavernoma was separated from Ethan&rsquo;s brain tissue,&rdquo; said Dr. Ranalli. &ldquo;Everything went well in surgery and we are pleased with the outcome.&rdquo;</p><p>Ethan spent four days at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital before he was discharged.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything happened so fast. Within 24 hours, we went from being at urgent care to being in recovery for brain surgery,&rdquo; said Atkins. &ldquo;As a family, we have never had to experience anything like this and everyone at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s was so helpful and kind. We were facing a challenging situation and their team helped to make it as easy as possible for us while providing excellent care.&rdquo;</p><p>After two weeks of home care, Ethan was cleared to return to school. He will continue to receive follow-up care with Dr. Ranalli at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital&#39;s Stys Neuroscience Institute is a collaboration between Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, and the UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville, plus other health care institutions that brings together a multispecialty team to help children with brain, spine, skull-base and other neurological conditions.</p><p><em>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital has been ranked repeatedly by <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/news/news-release/after-brain-tumor-diagnosis-7-year-old-and-his-family-put-their-trust-in-one-of-the-u-s-news-50-best-childrens-hospitals-for-cancer-and-neurology-neurosurgery\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> as one of the 50 best children&rsquo;s hospitals in the nation for neurology and neurosurgery.

You can prevent muscle strain from starting and reduce the pain that does arise with simple stretching.</p><p>&ldquo;The key to preventing pain associated with long periods of sitting is to start with proper posture,&rdquo; said Stephanie Wilkinson, a physical therapist for <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/rehabilitation-services\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Rehabilitation Services</a> at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville. &nbsp;&ldquo;Whether you are at your desk or in the car, you can set yourself up for pain-free sitting with a few easy adjustments to your space.&rdquo;</p><ul><li><strong>Lumbar support</strong> &ndash; Both your work chair and your car seat should provide lumbar support to your lower back, which in turn relieves tension in your shoulders and neck. Many work chairs and some car seats have built-in lumbar support controls that you can adjust to your comfort. Lumbar support accessories like cushions or mesh inserts are also available in a variety of styles and relatively cheap.</li><li><strong>Feet positioning</strong> &ndash; Under your desk, keep your feet are flat on the floor and ensure your chair supports your thighs to your knees. In the car, make sure your knees are bent and you can comfortably reach the pedals. For shorter people, cushions and footrests can help with achieving these positions.</li><li><strong>Limit unnecessary head and neck movement</strong> &ndash; Position the most used items on your desk (phone, staplers, keyboard and mouse, etc.) closely to you to avoid reaching and uncomfortable neck positions. While driving, adjust your mirrors to avoid excess neck straining and make sure your seat is high enough to see the road without having to look up or down.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Everyone is susceptible to pain from sitting too long,&rdquo; said Wilkinson. &ldquo;Movement is critical for preventing pain from developing. A stretch break every hour at your desk or every 90 minutes in the car will help limit your pain and give you a nice boost of energy.&rdquo;</p><ul><li><strong>Chin tuck</strong> &ndash; Slowly draw your head back so that your ears line up with your shoulders. Hold for 10 seconds.</li><li><strong>Cervical side bend</strong> &ndash; Tilt your head towards the side, hold for 30 seconds then return back to looking straight ahead. Repeat on the other side. Be sure to keep your eyes and nose pointed straight ahead the entire time.</li><li><strong>Shoulder rolls</strong> &ndash; Sit with arm resting on a table (or steering wheel). Rotate your shoulders backward, without shrugging them up, focusing on moving the shoulder while keeping the arm resting. Do 10 times circling backward and 10 times circling forwards.</li><li><strong>Wrist flexor stretch</strong> &ndash; Hold both arms out in front of you. Using the arm you want to stretch, point your fingers up towards the ceiling with your elbow straight. Using your other hand, pull your fingers back towards your wrist until you feel a stretch along your forearm. Hold for 30 seconds then switch sides.</li><li><strong>Wrist extensor stretch</strong> &ndash; Use your left hand to bend the right wrist down gently. Keep your elbow straight on the right side the entire time. Hold for 30 seconds then switch hands.</li></ul><p><em>Baptist Rehabilitation Services offer a variety of individualized programs to treat pain, injuries and chronic illnesses.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>If you&rsquo;re an American man, there&#39;s a one in 10 chance you could develop prostate cancer at some point during your life. In fact, it&rsquo;s the most common cancer in men after skin cancer.</p><p>About 175,000 new cases will be diagnosed in 2019, the third-highest number of new cancer cases after breast and lung cancers, according to the National Cancer Institute.</p><p>Unfortunately, many men never experience symptoms and without being screened, they may not know they have the disease.</p><p>But whether or not to get screened and how beneficial it actually is has been highly debated in the health community.</p><p>In 2012, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, an independent, volunteer panel of national experts that makes recommendations about clinical preventive services, recommended against screening altogether. The task force stated that the benefit of screening doesn&rsquo;t outweigh the risks of including false-positive results, which could lead to additional, unnecessary testing and prostate biopsy.</p><p><strong>Task Force reverses decision</strong></p><p>After various recent studies showed that PSA screening could be beneficial for certain age groups, ethnicities and people with a family history, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force reversed its recommendation.</p><p>&ldquo;Screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some men,&rdquo; the recommendations state.</p><p>The reversal has caused some confusion among physicians and patients.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/urologic-oncologist/dr-jonathan-melquist-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Melquist, MD</a>, a urologic oncologist at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>, who recently sent out a summary of the decision to Baptist Health physicians, said he believes prostate screening is as important as colon and breast cancer screenings.</p><p>&ldquo;Data reasonably supports screening for men 55 to 69 years old and even earlier if you have high-risk factors,&rdquo; Dr. Melquist said. &ldquo;Knowledge is power. You&rsquo;d rather know you have a low-risk cancer than not knowing you have a low-risk or high-risk cancer.&rdquo;</p><p>Prostate cancer is tested by measuring the amount of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an enzyme found in the blood. An elevated PSA level could be caused by prostate cancer or another inflammatory process of the prostate gland.</p><p><strong>What the new guidelines reveal</strong></p><p>The new guidelines established at the end of last year include;</p><ul><li>Encouraging men ages 55 to 69 to discuss potential benefits of screening with their physicians, as well as any negatives including false-positive results that could require additional testing and possible biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. The decision to screen for this age group should be an individual one based on the person&rsquo;s values and preferences, the guidelines state.</li><li>Recommending against screening for men 70 years and older based on life-expectancy data studied. PSA-based screening can lead to the diagnosis of prostate cancer in some men, especially over age 70, whose cancer would never have become symptomatic during their lifetime, according to the task force.</li></ul><p>Long-term studies found PSA-based screening for prostate cancer prevents 1.28 men from dying for every 1,000 men screened, more than previously thought.</p><p><strong>Some more at risk than others</strong></p><p>The American Urological Association has similar guidelines. But Dr. Melquist said the association offers additional recommendations based on a person&rsquo;s risk factors.</p><p>Screening can be pursued for ages 40 to 55 for:</p><ul><li>Those with a family history of aggressive or deadly cancer tumors (prostate, breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer) over multiple generations and in first-degree relatives as well as first-degree relatives who had prostate cancer at a young age.</li><li>African Americans who have a greater chance of developing prostate cancer because they are more likely to develop prostate cancer than men who are white (203.5 versus 121.9 cases per 100,000 men). Overall outcomes though for prostate cancer are positive since the disease advances slowly. Some studies show the 10-year survival rate for screen-detected, localized prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body is 99 percent</li></ul><p>Typically, there are no signs for prostate cancer, Dr. Melquist said, except when it has become aggressive or has spread throughout the body signifying the importance of screening.</p><p>Various treatment options for prostate cancer include removal of the prostate gland, radiation therapy or ongoing monitoring for those with low-risk prostate cancer. Cure rates are generally very high but are dependent on the pathologic type of the cancer.</p><p>&ldquo;Very few people die of prostate cancer. Even with the rarer high-grade prostate cancers, there is still a moderate chance for a cure,&rdquo; Dr. Melquist said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</em></a><em>&nbsp;offers a wide variety of therapies and treatment options for prostate, including radiation therapy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>It&rsquo;s a well-kept secret: Many people don&rsquo;t have the sex life they want.</p><p>And, how could you know? Men don&rsquo;t talk about it with their buddies over a beer. Women don&rsquo;t chat about it with their girlfriends during an after-yoga meet-up. Where the conversations show up in force is when women visit their gynecologist.</p><p>&ldquo;We hear it all the time. It&rsquo;s what people ask us about the most,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/gynecologist/dr-maryellen-wechter-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Ellen Wechter, MD</a>, a gynecologist with North Florida Gynecology Specialists, which serves patients at Baptist Health. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re already talking about the intimate details of their lives. When we ask how they&rsquo;re doing sexually, all of a sudden we become a source of information for a subject they have years of questions about.&rdquo;</p><p>Young women are the most forward. Menopausal women are typically a bit shy.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask older women if they are sexually active, and they say &lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t have any desire.&rsquo; But once you ask, they are very interested,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/gynecologist/dr-paulami-guha-md\" target=\"_blank\">Paulami Guha, MD</a>, also a gynecologist at North Florida Gynecology Specialists.</p><p>These problems have solutions. It simply begins with talking about it. Here are the most common suggestions Drs. Wechter and Guha give to women who want to improve their sex lives.</p><p><strong>Check your medications</strong></p><p>Certain hormonal birth control methods are known to cause vaginal dryness in some women, Dr. Guha said. Great sex and vaginal dryness don&rsquo;t mix. Ask your gynecologist for an alternative. Also, some anti-depressants come with sexual side effects. Ask your doctor if yours is one of them.</p><p><strong>Address the pregnancy/STD issue</strong></p><p>When women are worried about getting pregnant or catching a sexually transmitted disease (STD), they avoid sex. It&rsquo;s a problem that surfaces even with older women who are in a new relationship. Talk with your partner.</p><p>Birth control and STD prevention are the solutions, but that doesn&rsquo;t always mean the same thing. STDs are prevented by using condoms, in most cases, since many STD&rsquo;s are transmitted by exchanging sexual fluids. If herpes is an issue, partners should avoid sex during a flare-up since herpes can also be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact.</p><p>When a woman is the one who has the STD, she may avoid sex entirely because she&rsquo;s embarrassed. Herpes is one STD that still carries a huge stigma.</p><p>&ldquo;Women think their whole sex life is over because they have herpes. They think they&rsquo;re alone,&rdquo; Dr. Wechter said. &ldquo;But herpes is so common, many times both partners carry the virus.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, it becomes a non-issue. When only one partner has herpes, they can take antiviral medications to keep the other partner from catching it. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Treat painful intercourse</strong></p><p>Nothing kills the mood like painful sex. Pain is common among menopausal women because lower estrogen leads to less vaginal lubrication and stretchiness.</p><p>&ldquo;They may have the desire, but because it&rsquo;s painful, they&rsquo;re not having sex. So slowly, the desire also dies out,&rdquo; Dr. Guha said.</p><p>Topical estrogens&mdash;creams placed directly in the vagina&mdash;work fast, and often with dramatic effects. Since they&rsquo;re targeted hormone therapy, they carry a much lower risk of breast cancer than hormones taken as pills you swallow.</p><p>Pay attention to the kind of pain you&rsquo;re having. A deep pain that feels like your partner is bumping into something could signal a mass in the uterus or elsewhere. Fibroids, endometriosis and tumors are possible. Check with your gynecologist.</p><p><strong>Low libido? There&rsquo;s a root cause.</strong></p><p>Libido is a worry that cuts across all generations. Libido&mdash;also known as sex drive&mdash;is often less than a woman wants it to be. Even more often, it&rsquo;s less than a woman&rsquo;s partner wants it to be.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes I walk out of the clinic and I think &lsquo;Gosh 90% of the women today said they have a problem with libido.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s really common,&rdquo; Dr. Wechter said.</p><p>Low libido isn&rsquo;t a natural state. There&rsquo;s usually a root cause. Physical problems, emotional worries and stress are the most likely culprits.</p><p>Men&rsquo;s libidos benefit from high testosterone. For women, libido depends on a sense of well-being, self-care and emotional intimacy. A woman needs to have rest and feel good in her own skin in order to see physical intimacy as an attractive option.</p><p>Sometimes, not wanting sex is an early sign you&rsquo;re in an unhappy relationship. It&rsquo;s something Dr. Guha talks about a lot with younger patients. In a good relationship, both partners share the work and have a sense of mutual respect and love.</p><p>&ldquo;Feelings are the most important thing,&rdquo; Dr. Guha said. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s not working, the sex is not going to work either.&rdquo;</p><p><em>A quality sex life is important to a healthy relationship.

He or she is your partner in prevention, not just treatment.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait until you have a problem to see a doctor,&rdquo; explained Kelly Rich, MD, a family physician at Baptist Primary Care. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here for you before you get sick. Many screenings and tests help us stay on top of your health, as a team.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>8 Life-Saving Screenings</strong></p><p><strong>Blood Pressure Test</strong></p><p>Known as &ldquo;the silent killer,&rdquo; high blood pressure doesn&rsquo;t always have symptoms but can lead to stroke, blood clots, heart failure and other serious medical conditions.</p><p>&ldquo;The recommendation for blood pressure screening starts as early as the age of three,&rdquo; explained Dr. Rich. &ldquo;High blood pressure affects one in three adults and it&rsquo;s a growing problem in children.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>At each appointment, Dr. Rich has her patient&rsquo;s blood pressure checked. For those who have known complications or a family history of high blood pressure, blood pressure should be monitored more frequently. At-home blood pressure monitors can be purchased at <a href=\"https://www.walgreens.com/topic/healthcare-clinic/baptist-health-clinic.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">Walgreens</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;Knowing your family medical history is so valuable,&rdquo; said Dr. Rich. &ldquo;Keep you primary care physician updated of any changes in family history relating not just to high blood pressure, but to all medical conditions.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Pap Smear</strong></p><p>Ladies, we&rsquo;re talking to you! A <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/health-library/test/pap-test\" target=\"_blank\">Papanicolaou (Pap) smear</a> is a screening for cervical cancer, testing for the presence of precancerous or cancerous cells on the cervix. It&rsquo;s an essential part of a woman&rsquo;s health care.</p><p>The U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends that women between the ages of 21 and 65 be screened for cervical cancer with a Pap smear every three years. Average-risk women ages 30 to 65 should be screened every five years with both a Pap smear and HPV test.</p><p>Women younger than 21, older than 65 and those who have had a total hysterectomy don&rsquo;t need to have a Pap smear.</p><p>&ldquo;The Pap test is done to identify changes in the cervix before cancer develops or to find cervical cancer early, at its most treatable stage,&rdquo; explained Dr. Rich.</p><p>In 1940s, cervical cancer was a major cause of death among American women. However, when the Pap smear was introduced in the 1950s, the incidence of invasive cervical cancer decreased by more than 60% between 1955 and 1992.</p><p>&ldquo;We also know that nearly all cervical cancers are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV),&rdquo; said Dr. Rich. &ldquo;Vaccinations for HPV are also a critical part of preventing cervical cancer.&rdquo;</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/cancer/hpv-vaccine-not-just-for-women-and-teens\" target=\"_blank\">HPV vaccine</a> is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11. For those not vaccinated when younger, the vaccine is recommended for females age 13-26 and males age 13-21.</p><p>&ldquo;When it&rsquo;s time for vaccinations, primary care physicians can help keep you and your family on track,&rdquo; said Dr. Rich. &ldquo;Like screening, vaccines are an important part of prevention.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cholesterol Test</strong></p><p><br>Our bodies need a certain amount of cholesterol, but buildup of the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; cholesterol type (low-density lipoprotein or LDL) can be dangerous and increase risk of heart disease. &ldquo;Good&rdquo; cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein or HDL) helps remove other forms of cholesterol from your blood stream and its associated with a lower risk of heart disease.</p><p>Cholesterol testing is often done during routine blood work. For those without risk factors like obesity, family history or high blood pressure, recommended screening should begin at age 35 for males and 45 for females.</p><p>&ldquo;High cholesterol is often preventable and treatable,&rdquo; said Dr. Rich. &ldquo;However, there are no &lsquo;warning signs&rsquo; of too much bad cholesterol until it affects your arteries. That&rsquo;s why having a doctor test your cholesterol level is very important.&rdquo;</p><p>Tip for maintaining good cholesterol levels include:</p><ul><li>Eating a heart-healthy diet</li><li>Exercising regularly</li><li>Quitting smoking</li><li>Maintaining a healthy weight</li></ul><p><strong>Mammogram</strong></p><p>Like Pap smears, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/hill-breast-center\" target=\"_blank\">mammograms</a> save lives by finding breast cancer early, when treatment is most likely to be successful. Beginning at age 40, women should have an annual screening mammogram. For those with a family history of breast cancer, screening should start earlier.</p><p>Annual mammograms lower a woman&rsquo;s chance of death from breast cancer by 30-40% according to the American College of Radiology. Are these <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/womens-health/mammogram-myth-busters\" target=\"_blank\">mammogram myths</a> keeping you away from your regular screening?</p><p><strong>Calcium Scoring</strong></p><p>Coronary calcium scores are measured with a cardiac CT scan, a noninvasive way to learn more information about the presence and extent of calcified plaque in vessels that supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Coronary calcification is a marker for cholesterol plaque. It correlates with the severity of a patient&rsquo;s coronary artery disease but doesn&rsquo;t correlate with the degree of narrowing of the arteries,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-pamela-rama-md\" target=\"_blank\">Pamela Rama</a>, MD, cardiologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a>. As the score increases, the likelihood of significant coronary artery disease and cardiac events increase over the next 5 years.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Rama recommends calcium scoring to patients who are older than 35, especially smokers or those with a family history of early coronary artery disease. She said she also has patients who simply want to know their calcium score to know their risk for a cardiac event like heart attack. &nbsp;</p><p>A score of 1-10 means there is a small amount of plaque and risk for heart attack is low. Based on the severity of the findings, a patient can then work with a cardiologist to develop a plan of action to prevent a major cardiac event.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Colonoscopy</strong></p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/health-library/test/colonoscopy\" target=\"_blank\">colonoscopy</a> is an exam that views the inside of the colon, or large intestine, and rectum.</p><p>&ldquo;Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard of colorectal cancer screening,&rdquo; said Dr. Rich. &ldquo;Both men and women should have colonoscopies starting at age 50 and continue every 10 years.&rdquo; She also added that if you have a family history, screening should begin 10 years earlier.</p><p>According to the American Cancer Society, colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths among both men and women, but if caught early, colorectal cancer has a 90% survival rate.</p><p><strong>Depression Screening</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>If you&rsquo;ve had a physical or well visit recently, your health care provider likely asked these two questions:</p><ul><li>Over the last two weeks, how often have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things?</li><li>Over the last two weeks, how often have you been feeling down, depressed or hopeless?</li></ul><p>These questions, known as the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 or PHQ-2, are inquiries about the frequency of a depressed mood.</p><p>&ldquo;This screening is done to detect depression in a first-step approach,&rdquo; said Dr. Rich, who explained that patients who screen positive should be further evaluated. &ldquo;With the incidence of depression getting higher every year, this screening can make a critical difference in someone&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Diabetes Test</strong></p><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes in adults ages 40 to 70 who are overweight or obese, and also recommends repeating testing every three years if results are normal.</p><p>Diabetes is a long-term disease in which the body can&rsquo;t regulate the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Insulin is the hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Type 1 diabetes, which is less common, is often diagnosed in children or teens. With this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. With type 2 diabetes, often occurring in adulthood, the body is resistant to insulin.</p><p>A diabetes test can detect prediabetes, thus allowing patients to make lifestyle changes like losing weight, increasing activity and eating a healthy diet, to prevent type 2 diabetes. &nbsp;</p><p>Diabetes can lead to many health issues including heart disease kidney damage, a weakened immune system, and more.</p><p><strong>Each patient is unique in regards to family history and other disease risk factors. Your primary care physician (PCP) will know the right screenings for you and offer you an individualized approach to health care. Have a PCP on your team.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Looking for a primary care physician who&rsquo;s right for you?

This type of cell damage is a known precursor to heart disease and strokes.</p><p>&ldquo;The preliminary data is disconcerting,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-andre-macedo-dias-md\" target=\"_blank\">Andre Macedo Dias, MD</a>, a cardiologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a>. &ldquo;It raises awareness that we should not just use e-cigarettes as if they were completely harmless&rdquo;</p><p>In the study, researchers exposed endothelial cells in a lab-grown setting to six e-liquids with different flavorings. The endothelium is a thin membrane lining the inside of the heart and blood vessels. The endothelial cells exposed to e-liquids showed signs of damage and death.</p><p>Killing endothelial cells is not a good thing. The blood vessels are supposed to be wide open pipes, Dr. Dias said. When the vessels become damaged, they sometimes regenerate with scar tissue. That&rsquo;s how blockages begin.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything that stretches the inner part of the arteries starts the progression of arterial sclerosis [a hardening or narrowing of the arteries],&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s why we think vaping is going to lead to serious cardiovascular conditions.&rdquo;</p><p>The findings matter, not just for smokers trying to quit, but also, for non-smoking teens, who are picking up e-cigarettes at an alarming rate.</p><p>A two-decade drop in teen tobacco smoking&mdash;from 28% in 1997 to 5% in 2018&mdash;has now been reversed by an epidemic of e-cigarette use. In 2018, 27.6% of teens said they had vaped at least once over the last month, according to a report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; Office of Adolescent Health.</p><p>&ldquo;They want to smoke and they know regular cigarettes are dangerous,&rdquo; Dr. Dias said. They think this is cool, and they believe it&rsquo;s harmless. The consequences are still unknown, but this is the group that is going to become addicted to e-cigarettes and face those consequences.&rdquo;</p><p>E-cigarettes came on the scene about a decade ago. Marketed as a smoking cessation device, the flavor and feel of e-cigs mimic regular cigarettes and allow users to progress over time to formulas that deliver lower and lower doses of nicotine.</p><p>Today E-cigarettes come in thousands of flavors. But critics say some, like bubblegum and tutti frutti, are targeting non-smoking teens. In 2016 the FDA outlawed the sale of e-cigs to anyone under 18. Federal policymakers have also made moves to regulate e-cig flavors. &nbsp;</p><p>Even though e-cigarettes eliminate the tobacco smoke that irritates and inflames lung tissue, they still contain waste chemicals that could have long-term effects, Dr. Dias said. Several waste chemicals in tobacco cigarettes, for example, are known to cause cancer.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like people are just vaping water,&rdquo; Dr. Dias said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have enough studies yet. But e-cigarettes should be used with caution and probably only as a last resort by a person who is really trying to quit smoking.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Are you wondering how common habits affect your heart health?

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>True story: A few years ago, a local high school football player scored four touchdowns in a game to lead his team to victory.</p><p>While a number of his teammates were succumbing to leg <nobr style=\"font-size: inherit\"><a class=\"pxInta\" href=\"#\" id=\"PXLINK_1_0_1\">cramps</a></nobr> on that hot and humid Friday night, this player never <a class=\"pxInta\" href=\"#\" id=\"PXLINK_1_0_1\">lost</a> his stride, participating in all three phases of the game, offense, defense and special teams.</p><p>After the game, the winning coach told reporters that the secret to his star player&rsquo;s success was none other than pickle juice.</p><p>Because it contains sodium, potassium and antioxidants, pickle juice can help restore the electrolytes lost when you sweat. A teaspoon or two of yellow mustard has also been known to <a class=\"pxInta\" href=\"#\" id=\"PXLINK_2_0_2\">ease</a> the <nobr style=\"font-size: inherit\"><a class=\"pxInta\" href=\"#\" id=\"PXLINK_0_0_0\">pain</a></nobr> of <a class=\"pxInta\" href=\"#\" id=\"PXLINK_0_0_0\">muscle</a> cramps. Some research suggests that a daily capsule of B <a class=\"pxInta\" href=\"#\" id=\"PXLINK_1_0_1\">vitamins</a> may prevent cramps as well.</p><p>Today, pickle juice can be found in a variety of products, from sports drinks to popsicles and even slushies. Paul Provenzano, DPT, lead physical therapist at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-beaches\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Beaches</a>, said drinking a little pickle juice or potassium-rich apple cider vinegar before bed can help ease leg cramps overnight.</p><p>&ldquo;Leg cramps can be caused by a number of factors, from too much activity to not enough activity,&rdquo; said Provenzano. &ldquo;Just standing too long can give your leg cramps. I tell my patients to stretch or <a class=\"pxInta\" href=\"#\" id=\"PXLINK_2_0_2\">massage</a> their feet and legs before bed to help loosen up muscles for better blood flow.&rdquo;</p><p>Provenzano said the majority of his patients are over the age of 65 and many of them complain of nocturnal <a class=\"pxInta\" href=\"#\" id=\"PXLINK_1_0_1\">leg pain</a>. Some of it may be due to the medications they are taking, including potent diuretics, which can induce cramps by depleting body fluid and sodium.</p><p>&ldquo;Blood pools when you are lying down. When you get a leg cramp at night, the first thing you should do is stand up and put weight on the leg because that turns on your nervous system and activates the muscle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a term we use in PT called reciprocal inhibition, which describes the <a class=\"pxInta\" href=\"#\" id=\"PXLINK_0_0_0\">process</a> of the muscles on one side of a joint relaxing to accommodate contraction on the other side of the joint. Once you <a class=\"pxInta\" href=\"#\" id=\"PXLINK_0_0_0\">contract</a> the muscle, the muscle on the other side of the joint starts to relax.&rdquo;</p><p>Before he became a doctor of physical therapy, Provenzano spent nearly a decade as a project manager for a large construction firm. He said muscle cramps are a common occurrence on construction sites this time of year. But you don&rsquo;t have to wear a hard hat to get them. Simply massaging the cramped muscle helps, he added.</p><p><em>Physical therapists provide treatment for a wide array of impairments and injuries.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Birthday cards for women over 50 are rife with jokes about menopause. But for many women experiencing its symptoms, it is anything but funny. While most women are glad to say goodbye to periods, the hot flashes, irritability and sleep disturbances that may come with menopause can affect the quality of life.</p><p>So, how do you know if you have officially reached menopause? Menopause is just what it sounds like &ndash; a pause in &ldquo;menses,&rdquo; or menstruation. It&rsquo;s diagnosed after a woman has gone 12 months without a period. It usually happens in your 40s or 50s, with the average age being 51.</p><p>Most common symptoms include:</p><ul><li>Hot flashes</li><li>Night sweats</li><li>Vaginal dryness</li><li>Mood changes or irritability</li><li>Sexual issues</li></ul><p>Gynecologic surgeons <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/gynecologist/dr-maryellen-wechter-md\">Mary Ellen Wechter, MD,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/gynecologist/dr-paulami-guha-md\">Paulami Guha, MD,</a> with North Florida Gynecology Specialists at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a> helped shed light on what&rsquo;s fact, fiction and how to navigate the big &ldquo;M.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>You&rsquo;ll gain weight, especially in your mid-section: Maybe.</strong><br>&ldquo;The hormonal changes of menopause slow metabolism and may lead to weight gain, especially in the mid-section,&rdquo; said Dr. Guha.</p><p>&ldquo;But there are other factors that cause weight gain that happen at the same time, like aging, a more sedentary lifestyle and genetics,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Gaining weight is not inevitable. Limiting simple carbs, being more active and eating more fruits and vegetables can make a difference.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Your sex drive will crash: Maybe.</strong><br>Many women report having a lower sex drive during menopause. According to The Journal of Women&#39;s Health, women with more severe menopausal symptoms are more likely to report lower libido levels.</p><p>One of the main culprits is lower estrogen levels, which change the collagen quality of the vaginal skin, making the tissue thinner, less stretchy, and possibly less sensitive to stimulation. It also causes vaginal dryness which can make sex painful.</p><p>To help with dryness, Dr. Wechter recommends using oil for lubricant &ndash; even natural oils like olive oil will work. For over-the-counter solutions, she recommends a silicone-based lubricant rather than a water-based lubricant because they restore moisture for the long-term. Estrogen applied vaginally can help reverse the vaginal changes of menopause, such as dryness.</p><p>&ldquo;There are a lot of other barriers that can get in the way of sex, like stress, fatigue, depression and body image,&rdquo; Dr. Wechter said. &ldquo;Work with your doctor to pinpoint these barriers so you can get find solutions and get back to enjoying sex.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>You will have menopausal symptoms forever: Not exactly.</strong><br>&ldquo;Symptoms are usually worse during the first few years of menopause and usually decrease in frequency and intensity,&rdquo; said Dr. Guha. &ldquo;But every woman is different. Sometimes hot flashes will stop and start again a few years later.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Bleeding during menopause is normal: False</strong><br>Bleeding during perimenopause (the time before menopause) is normal, but if you haven&rsquo;t had a period in 12 months and experience bleeding, see your gynecologist.</p><p>&ldquo;This is a red flag you shouldn&rsquo;t ignore,&rdquo; said Dr. Guha. &ldquo;It could be harmless, or it could be something more serious, like endometrial or uterine cancer.<br>&ldquo;Any bleeding during menopause should be examined by a doctor immediately.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the best way to reduce symptoms: Not always.</strong><br>Since so many menopausal symptoms are related to a reduction in hormones, HRT is often a viable way to get relief. HRT helps to replace estrogen and progesterone.</p><p>&ldquo;HRT can be a good way to minimize symptoms, but only if the benefits outweigh the risks,&rdquo; said Dr. Guha. There have been studies linking hormone therapy to increased risk of stroke, heart attacks and breast cancer.</p><p>&ldquo;For example, if I have a patient with minimal symptoms like occasional night sweats but who has a family history of breast cancer, I would not recommend HRT,&rdquo; Dr. Guha said. &ldquo;But if a patient&rsquo;s symptoms are interfering with her quality of life and there&rsquo;s no family history, HRT can be a good solution.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Guha stressed that it&rsquo;s important to make sure that HRT formulations are FDA-approved before taking them. Hormones that are delivered in a gel, a patch or as a suppository generally have fewer risk and side effects.</p><p>&ldquo;No matter how hormones are administered, it&rsquo;s best to use the lowest dosage for the shortest amount of time,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><strong>There&rsquo;s nothing you can do about hot flashes: False.</strong><br>Hot flashes occur in 75-80% of menopausal women, but only 20-30% seek medical advice, according to Dr. Guha.</p><p>If your hot flashes are mild, lifestyle changes might help. Limit your intake of caffeine, alcohol and hot and spicy foods, which can all be triggers. Wearing light-weight clothing and staying in cool environments can help too.</p><p>For more frequent and severe hot flashes, the most effective treatment is HRT, but only if you are good candidate. (See above.) Some antidepressants, as well as blood pressure and anti-seizure medications, can be effective for some women.</p><p>Over-the-counter supplements, like black cohosh, soy, ginseng or flaxseed, may provide a placebo effect, but there have been no conclusive studies verifying their effectiveness. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>There are some good aspects of menopause: True</strong><br>It&rsquo;s not all a Debbie Downer&hellip;For many women, freedom from periods and pre-menstrual syndrome outweigh their menopausal symptoms. There can also be a feeling of freedom because pregnancy is no longer a concern.</p><p>And for those who have menopausal symptoms, Dr. Wechter emphasized: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suffer in silence &ndash; there are solutions. Talk with your gynecologist to find out what will work for you.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you&rsquo;re looking for an OB/GYN to help you manage your gynecologic health, call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"tel:1-904-202-4437\"><em>904.202.4HER</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

Or, do you often misinterpret things people say?</p><p>If so, you may be one of about 15% or more than 37 million adults age 18 and over who have trouble hearing. That percentage increases to about 50% for people 75 and older.</p><p>But hearing loss impacts adults and children of all ages. In fact, statistics show that one in eight people in the U.S. who are 12 years or older have hearing loss in both ears. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that less than half of adults who reported hearing problems saw a health care provider about their hearing in the past five years.</p><p>And while about 28.8 million adults could benefit from using hearing aids, only 16% have ever used them, according to the National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/audiologist/angela-johnson-aud\" target=\"_blank\">Angela Johnson, Aud</a>, an audiologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-ent-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist ENT Specialists</a>, said the onset of hearing loss is typically gradual so people are often unaware of the extent of its effects, including personality changes, confusion and aloofness.</p><p><strong>Signs of hearing loss</strong></p><p>In addition to making volume adjustments on electronics and phones, and asking people to repeat what they say, some other signs of hearing loss &nbsp;include:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Struggling to hear</li><li>Hearing but not understanding what people say</li><li>Misinterpreting words</li><li>Hearing mumbling sounds when people speak</li></ul><p>&ldquo;People often say, `I know someone is talking to me, but I can&rsquo;t clarify what the words actually are.&rsquo; They hear the voice, but can&rsquo;t make out what the person is saying to them,&rdquo; Dr. Johnson said.</p><p>People with hearing loss generally wait years before seeking help. But delays can also cause stress, anxiety, depression, low morale, isolation, risk of cognitive decline and even health problems.</p><p>&ldquo;Hearing aids can make listening a lot easier and a lot less effortful so you are not frustrated or tired at the end of the day because you are working so hard trying to hear,&rdquo; Johnson said.</p><p><strong>Not realizing what you&rsquo;re missing</strong></p><p>Sometimes people don&rsquo;t realize they have a hearing loss because their brain has adapted to the decrease in hearing.</p><p>&ldquo;Each year you age, your brain gets used to the changes and thinks this is what normal sounds like. It&rsquo;s hard to realize what you are missing if you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Dr. Johnson said. &ldquo;People think they are getting by and then when they hear through a hearing aid, they realize, `I should have been hearing this all the time.&rsquo; Once they hear how clear and crisp things are supposed to sound, most don&rsquo;t want to go without their hearing aids again.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s also been a stigma when it comes to hearing aids. But hearing aids today are not like your grandfather&rsquo;s from 20 or more years ago.</p><p>&ldquo;Hearing aids have changed drastically in recent years,&rdquo; Dr. Johnson said. &nbsp;&ldquo;New features have revolutionized how smart and discreet these devices can be. There&rsquo;s a stigma that hearing aids make people look old, yet age doesn&rsquo;t necessarily determine when hearing loss may begin. It can happen at any age.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Johnson said family members and friends generally notice first that an individual they care about is having hearing problems and asking them to repeat what they said or that their loved one is not joining in on the conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;If the same person wore a hearing aid and was able to communicate seamlessly, no one would likely even notice a hearing aid was the reason,&rdquo; Johnson added. &ldquo;Patients who have accepted their hearing loss and are emotionally ready for help are likely to be more successful in their hearing aid journey.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Various brands use smart technology so you can make volume adjustments for different settings (i.e. a noisy restaurant) from your cell phone via Bluetooth. People can also stream T.V. shows and listen to podcasts through their hearing aid. Instead of charging a battery once a week, hearing aids can be put on a charger overnight like charging a cellphone. They are also easily concealed with various colors to match people&rsquo;s hair color and skin tone.</p><p>Hearing aids work, Dr. Johnson said, by receiving sound through a microphone, either on top or in the ear. The sounds are then digitally converted and sent through an amplifier. The amplifier makes the signal louder and sends it to the ear through a speaker.</p><p>&ldquo;We talk to patients about their lifestyle and listening needs to help determine which hearing aid will work best for them,&rdquo; Dr. Johnson said.</p><p><strong>Steps to take if you have hearing loss</strong></p><p>When to get a hearing test depends on the individual and whether they are experiencing problems. But Johnson said it&rsquo;s important to get a baseline hearing test between the ages of 55 and 60 so you can be monitored for any changes.</p><p>&ldquo;Your hearing should be checked regularly, just like eye exams,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;Your ears are just as important as your eyes or any other part of your body. The longer you wait to address your hearing loss, the longer your brain goes without good input. Early intervention is key in how successful you may be in the long run with hearing aids, so the sooner you address the issue, the better.&rdquo;</p><p>Adjustment times vary between patients. A 30-day trial period is included with all hearing aid purchases and during that time follow-up appointments are utilized to help patients adjust at their own pace. During that month, patients are typically seen two to four times for adjustments, Johnson said.</p><p>While hearing aids are not typically covered by insurance, there is a wide range of pricing depending on technology levels.</p><p><em>Baptist ENT Specialists provides comprehensive hearing evaluations performed by doctoral-level audiologists who work closely with the ear, nose and throat physicians. The evaluation includes ruling out any underlying medical issues and a hearing test to assess what degree of hearing loss a person may have.

When you throw in the beach towels, sunscreen and sunglasses, consider adding vinegar to be ahead of the dreaded jellyfish sting.</p><p>There&rsquo;s nothing worse when you&rsquo;re swimming along to be shocked by the sharp sting of the drifting marine animal.</p><p>As a nurse practitioner at the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/care-options\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health Clinic at Walgreens</a>, co-owner of a surf camp and a mom, I&rsquo;m interested in helping beach-goers bust myths about the treatment of jellyfish stings.</p><p>Tiny or enormous, jellyfish come in all shapes and sizes. Some have tiny stinging cells called nematocysts in their tentacles. A jellyfish sting is like a thousand tiny spears injecting you with poison all at once. The jellyfish tentacles have millions of lances embedded in the nematocysts, which launch the stingers out into your skin upon contact. &nbsp;They latch on and let loose a stream of venom, which can be mildly annoying, extremely painful or even life threatening. No matter the severity, a sting can pretty much ruin a beach day in an instant.</p><p><strong>Age-old myths</strong></p><ul><li>It turns out urinating on the sting site won&rsquo;t help. Urea, found in urine, helps with tentacle removal but urine is too diluted for it take away the sting.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t rinse with cold water, which can cause the stingers to release more venom.</li><li>Baking soda isn&rsquo;t dangerous, but it doesn&rsquo;t help much either. Some people think baking soda neutralizes the venom but other remedies are more effective.</li><li>Trying to scrape away the tentacles can cause the jellyfish nematocysts to release more venom, which are triggered in part by pressure.</li><li>Alcohol isn&rsquo;t a good idea either as it can cause nematocysts to fire more.</li><li>Rinsing with sea water might actually make the pain worse as well.</li></ul><p><strong>Ouch! What do I do?</strong></p><p>Following a sting, take these steps as quickly as possible:</p><ol><li>Pour highly concentrated vinegar on the sting site. Vinegar deactivates the jellyfish&rsquo;s nematocysts so they can&rsquo;t fire.</li><li>Remove the tentacles with tweezers or a gloved hand while continuing to rinse with vinegar.</li><li>Apply a heat pack or immerse the affected area in water of a temperature at least 113 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 minutes.</li><li>Stay out of the water for the rest of the day. Remember, salt water may make the pain worse.</li></ol><p>Pharmacies also sell commercially packaged products for stings, like StingNoMore&reg;, which contain highly concentrated vinegar and urea.</p><p><strong>If the itching continues</strong></p><p>If the jellyfish sting causes pain and itching for a few days:</p><ul><li>Apply hot packs to reduce swelling and inflammation.</li><li>Take pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.</li><li>Apply a topical antibiotic cream, such as Neosporin&reg; to reduce your risk of infection.</li><li>Take an over-the-counter antihistamine (i.e., Benadryl&reg; or Zyrtec&reg;).</li><li>Ensure you are up to date on your tetanus vaccine if the sting creates an open wound.</li></ul><p><strong>Doc or not?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Jellyfish stings are more dangerous for those will jellyfish allergies, individuals with compromised immune systems, or very young or very old people.</p><p>Any sign of shock or an allergic reaction warrant prompt emergency care. Call 911 or go to an emergency department.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, recently published a study with some interesting findings for three particular age groups. The team discovered that loneliness peaks at three ages for most people: the late 20s, mid-50s and late 80s. More than 300 San Diego County residents between the ages of 27 and 101 participated in the study.</p><p>When it comes to why these three age groups are most at risk, however, the scientists still have work to do. For those in their 20s, they speculate that because this age involves making many life decisions, it may increase loneliness as old relationships end and people experience guilt over their choices. For people in their 50s, the working theory is that this is the time when health begins to decline, and friends begin passing away. And in the 80s age group, deaths of family, friends and spouses may leave a person without as many deep connections.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/nicole-winter-psyd\" target=\"_blank\">Nicole Winter, PsyD</a>, a clinical psychologist at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/agewell-center-for-senior-health\" target=\"_blank\">AgeWell Center for Senior Health</a>, says it&rsquo;s important to know that loneliness doesn&rsquo;t just strike those who are physically alone.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe that loneliness is more about feeling alone rather than actually being alone. I prefer to differentiate loneliness from solitariness in that solitary means preferring to be alone and lonely means suffering from being alone or feeling isolated. I am a strong believer that even those with several friends or social contacts can still feel lonely and that loneliness isn&rsquo;t always negative.&rdquo;</p><p>With that understanding, Dr. Winter explains why she thinks loneliness hits at each of these age milestones. For those in their twenties, a little bit of loneliness may just be part of growing up and spreading your wings.</p><p>&ldquo;Our late 20s is a time often accompanied by problems with money as college ends, career confusion or difficulty and romantic challenges. It is during this timeframe when we generally become more independent by branching off from parents and college friends and expect to have a career, committed relationship, and fabulous social life. If by this time we do not, people in this age group can feel as if they have already failed. Add in the unrealistic expectations highlighted on social media and that can be a recipe for feeling lost, alone and, ultimately, lonely.&rdquo;</p><p>People in their 50s, however, may experience heightened loneliness as they struggle to determine their wants and needs, while their peers may seem to have it all together.</p><p>&ldquo;Middle age can be an especially lonely phase of life as a result of feeling confused as to who we are and who we will be, in addition to disappointments and anxieties of unfulfilling work, unhappy family life and our own or others&rsquo; poor health,&rdquo; says Dr. Winter.</p><p>Dr. Winter agrees with the study&rsquo;s researchers that the 80s may bring on loneliness simply because, by that age, many people have lost a number of their deep relationships.</p><p>&ldquo;Loneliness is a common source of distress, suffering, and impaired quality of life in older persons. With age often comes a multitude of life changes such as the death of loved ones, retirement, stressful life events, or dealing with various medical issues, all of which can increase the risk for and susceptibility to loneliness,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important for doctors to address loneliness with patients of these ages because it can have negative effects on health besides just making a person feel down.</p><p>&ldquo;Persistent loneliness is not only emotionally and mentally painful but can be damaging to physical health. The most common negative effects I see in those who identify as feeling lonely include experiences of depression and anxiety, poor or disturbed sleep in both quantity and quality, reduced immune and cardiovascular functioning, functional impairment, and signs of early cognitive decline,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>In order to avoid these health consequences, no matter the age or cause of loneliness, Dr. Winter says changing your thought process can help you have positive, productive relationships with others.</p><p>&ldquo;Persistent loneliness often makes individuals increasingly sensitive to rejection. They often have a tendency to convey negativity and remember and pay more attention to the negative, which ultimately leads to increased negative expectations or pushing others away because of perceived rejection,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Changing maladaptive thinking is the process of identifying, testing and challenging negative thoughts when they occur. During this process, an individual learns to consider other possibilities and practice trying to see things from the perspective of others. Then they&rsquo;re able to interpret their actions more benignly. Once the negative thoughts are challenged and eventually eliminated, a person who identifies as feeling lonely can begin approaching new relationships with a positive, optimistic outlook.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you feel alone or isolated more often than not, call </em><a href=\"tel:1-904-376-3800\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.376.3800</em></a><em> to find a Baptist Behavioral Health provider who can help you find a solution.</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;Study: </em><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-psychogeriatrics/article/high-prevalence-and-adverse-health-effects-of-loneliness-in-communitydwelling-adults-across-the-lifespan-role-of-wisdom-as-a-protective-factor/FCD17944714DF3C110756436DC05BDE9\" target=\"_blank\"><em>cambridge.org/core/journals</em></a></p>",

Reapply at least every 2 hours.</p><p><strong>Cover up.</strong> A broad-rimmed hat, sunglasses (with UV protection) and lightweight, light-colored clothing will minimize your exposure.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Life is supposed to be simple when you&rsquo;re 7 years old. Logan Silva&rsquo;s life revolved around the soccer field, until he was sidelined by a concussion. Little did he or his parents know, that injury may have indirectly saved his life.</p><p>&ldquo;If that hadn&rsquo;t happened, we might not have pushed so hard to find out what was wrong. And then the tumor could have grown,&rdquo; said Daniel Silva, Logan&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;Maybe it was a blessing in disguise.&rdquo;</p><p>For two months after his injury, Logan suffered from headaches that seemed to come out of nowhere. Logan&rsquo;s pediatrician initially believed it was lingering effects of the concussion, but the headaches grew worse and were soon accompanied by nausea and vomiting.</p><p>On September 30, 2017, Logan got an MRI at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville.</p><p>&ldquo;After they were done with the scans, the MRI tech came out and said there was a room in the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/emergency\" target=\"_blank\">ER </a>that was waiting for us, and that we would meet a doctor there to discuss the results,&rdquo; Silva said. &ldquo;So obviously we knew something was going on.&rdquo;</p><p>The MRI revealed medulloblastoma, a fast-growing brain tumor located in the cerebellum, the lower, rear portion of the brain. Additionally, the tumor was blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to a buildup of fluid in the ventricles of the brain known as hydrocephalus, the cause of Logan&rsquo;s excruciating headaches and nausea.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-neurosurgeon/dr-nathan-ranalli-md\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Ranalli, MD</a>, a pediatric neurosurgeon with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s and the UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville, performed an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) the next day to treat the hydrocephalus. During this procedure, a small hole is made in the frontal portion of the skull through which an endoscope &ndash; a small tube-like surgical camera &ndash; is passed through the brain and into the ventricular system. Dr. Ranalli then made a small opening to create a new pathway through which Logan&rsquo;s cerebrospinal fluid could flow around his tumor.&nbsp;</p><p>Two days later, Dr. Ranalli performed surgery to remove the tumor. The Pathology Lab confirmed it was medulloblastoma.</p><p>Logan recovered first in the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (<a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/supporting-services/picu\" target=\"_blank\">PICU</a>) before being transferred to the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/cancer\" target=\"_blank\">oncology </a>floor. A condition known as posterior fossa syndrome, which sometimes occurs in children who undergo surgery in that portion of the brain, left him unable to walk or talk.</p><p>&ldquo;Logan&rsquo;s great courage and determination gave him the strength to get through this,&rdquo; Silva said.</p><p>Following intense inpatient rehabilitation, 30 proton treatments at <a href=\"https://www.floridaproton.org/\" target=\"_blank\">UF Health Proton Therapy Institute</a>, and six rounds of chemotherapy, Logan is still pushing forward.</p><p>Now 9 years old, Logan just finished third grade. His brain scans have been clear since August 2018. While he still has difficulty with coordination, along with slow speech and cognitive processing, he continues to work toward one goal: a return to the soccer field.</p><p>When the Silvas turned to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital in their toughest hour, they didn&rsquo;t know it consistently ranks among <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>&rsquo;s 50 Best Children&rsquo;s Hospitals in the nation for Pediatric Cancer and Neurology &amp; Neurosurgery. But that&rsquo;s exactly what they wanted for Logan.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that we would have gotten better treatment anywhere else in the country,&rdquo; Silva said. &ldquo;I can tell you that Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital focuses on a culture of care for patients and their parents. And it comes through loud and clear.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Year after year, Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital is ranked among </em>U.S. News &amp; World Report<em>&rsquo;s top children&rsquo;s hospitals in the country.

Crozier points to recent data, for example, that was presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology in October 2018, and led to the recent FDA decision. The data showed that combining chemotherapy and immunotherapy in patients with metastatic (stage IV) triple-negative breast cancer reduced the risk of the disease worsening or even death.</p><p>There are three clinical trials at Baptist MD Anderson looking at immunotherapy for patients with various stages of triple-negative breast cancer and patients with other breast cancers. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In the next couple of years, we are hopeful there will be data to support using immunotherapy in breast cancer as a standard of care,&rdquo; Dr. Crozier explained.</p><p><em>Find out more about the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/patient-info/baptist-md-anderson\" target=\"_blank\">cancer trial</a>s that are underway at Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center. </em></p>",

While other people stared at and walked around the crying and screaming 9-year-old, Jen Whelchel chose empathy over judgment and laid down on the floor with the boy, who has autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&nbsp;</p><p>The simple gesture meant everything to the boy&#39;s parents.</p><p>According to the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in 59 children has autism spectrum disorder (ASD), up from one in 69 just two years prior.</p><p>ASD is a developmental condition characterized by difficulty with communication and social interaction.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In recent years, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders broadened the criteria for diagnosing children with ASD, helping professionals better identify children who show early signs,&rdquo; said Lauren Papke, SLP, a pediatric speech-language pathologist with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Rehabilitation Services and team lead for the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/rehabilitation/early-autism-intervention-program\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Rehabilitation Autism and Neurodevelopment Center</a>. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still a marked increase year after year and researchers aren&rsquo;t quite sure why.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-infectious-disease-specialist/dr-mobeen-rathore-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mobeen Rathore, MD,</a> is chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease and Immunology for <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>. He agreed with Papke that more definitive answers aren&rsquo;t available.</p><p>&ldquo;Studies such as this one from the CDC help us adequately prepare to treat the volume of children who need our services. But we can&rsquo;t attribute this increase to any one thing,&rdquo; said Dr. Rathore. &ldquo;Unfortunately, when it comes to autism, there are things we just don&rsquo;t know yet.&rdquo;</p><p>There is evidence that Dr. Rathore and Papke are right about why the rate of diagnosis is rising. Providers are identifying signs of autism earlier in patients&rsquo; lives than ever before &mdash; Dr. Rathore sees many patients who are diagnosed between eight months and two years of age.</p><p>The definition of autism has also changed over the years. Treating the condition as a spectrum rather than a strict set of traits means children may be flagged for evaluation sooner, and then receive services earlier. While these factors may be why diagnoses are up, experts still can&rsquo;t pinpoint what causes autism spectrum disorder is in the first place. However, one reason has been safely ruled out.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what causes autism,&rdquo; Dr. Rathore said. &ldquo;There are lots of theories being researched. I can tell you what does not cause autism: vaccines. That myth, based on a now-debunked study, has been put to rest by innumerable studies. We need to continue investigating what does cause autism and how we can manage it even better.&rdquo;</p><p>As researchers work toward answers, how can parents know if their child&rsquo;s development is cause for concern?</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a difficult challenge. My own son, who graduated from Harvard, didn&rsquo;t walk until he was 12 months old or speak until 14 months. My family was very concerned,&rdquo; said Dr. Rathore. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s most important is to maintain regular visits with the child&rsquo;s pediatrician. If you notice something different about your child, bring it up with your child&rsquo;s pediatrician and ask for an assessment early on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are many signs and symptoms of autism, but what parents need to focus on are lack of eye contact and limited shared smiles with their caregivers,&rdquo; explained Papke. &ldquo;They may have a lower verbal word count compared to other children their age, and they may have difficulty following directions.&rdquo;</p><p>Papke emphasized that early intervention is key in treating children with autism. &ldquo;We need to start treatment before the age of four,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, we have the Autism Early Intervention Program that specifically targets these young children with symptoms of autism. Our therapists are all certified in the Early Start Denver Model, which is the only scientifically proven treatment model for children with autism. We also work closely with the families to provide the child&rsquo;s caregivers with different strategies for interacting and supporting their child&rsquo;s development.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Concerned parents should discuss evaluation options with the child&rsquo;s doctor, who can recommend specialists to evaluate the child, help parents implement speech-language therapy and occupational therapy, and connect the family with invaluable community resources.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>In 2019 alone, there have already been more than a dozen school shootings with injuries or deaths across the United States. A CNN report on the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., said there has been a school shooting, on average, every 12 days.</p><p>Despite that scary statistic, the reality is that armed assailants in schools account for just 1% of homicides among school-age youth, according to a joint report from the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) and the National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO). Statistically, your child is extremely safe at school. Still, every school prepares for the unthinkable, most commonly by doing lockdown drills. Can growing up in the &ldquo;Code Red&rdquo; generation affect the mental wellbeing of kids and teens?</p><p><strong>Lights out, doors locked</strong><br>It&rsquo;s a common phrase used in classrooms around the country, a signal for children to quietly hide in a corner out of view of doors and windows.</p><p>&ldquo;Lockdown drills are really important parts of safety and crisis prevention programs for schools,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-michelle-mcdonald-phd\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle McDonald, PhD</a>, a child and adolescent psychologist at the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Center for Behavioral Health</a>. &ldquo;We know that as long as schools are following best practices, lockdowns are very effective.&rdquo;</p><p>A list of best practices created by the NASP and the NASRO includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Informing students and staff when a drill is going to occur.&nbsp;</strong>That includes telling them whether props or sound effects will be used.</li><li><strong>Making sure the drills are appropriate to age and developmental level.&nbsp;</strong>Staff should be trained to monitor students and recognize signs of trauma or anxiety and remove students, if necessary.</li><li><strong>Taking children with special needs or those who have experienced past trauma into consideration.</strong> They are most prone to experiencing fear or anxiety as a result of the drill.</li><li><strong>Involving school-employed mental health professionals in the planning of the drill.</strong> Make sure counselors are accessible to students and staff during and after the drill.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;We can mitigate a lot of the stress and anxiety that can come along with lockdown drills as long as these best practices are followed,&rdquo; said Dr. McDonald.</p><p><strong>Mommy, why do I have to practice hiding?</strong><br>Younger children may not understand why schools hold lockdown drills, so parents of elementary and pre-school age children may face questions like &ldquo;Who am I hiding from?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is someone trying to hurt me?&rdquo; Dr. McDonald says parents should answer those questions honestly but avoid language that may be alarming or anxiety-provoking.</p><p>Try something like: &ldquo;We practice to make sure that we stay safe and know what to do if ever something were to happen in the building that would make us unsafe.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. McDonald reiterated that parents should emphasize to children that schools are safe, and students are practicing &ldquo;just in case.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>I&rsquo;m afraid to go to school</strong><br>High school students are old enough to be aware of current events and understand any threats that may be made to their schools. Therefore, Dr. McDonald said conversations are happening frequently between teens and parents in which the teens express fear of going to school.</p><p>In this situation, McDonald suggested parents validate their child&rsquo;s concerns to show they are listening and then start a discussion about what makes the teen feel unsafe. If there are changes the teen feels need to be made within the school, he or she should bring it to the attention of teachers and/or school administration. It may also help to discuss ways the teen can ensure his or her own safety, like not opening the door for strangers and making sure to follow lockdown drills and procedures calmly and directly.</p><p>&ldquo;Children learn best when they feel safe and secure,&rdquo; Dr. McDonald said.</p><p><strong>Changes to be on the lookout for</strong><br>Changes in the three categories below could signal that your child is struggling with stress or anxiety from lockdowns and lockdown drills, or something else.</p><ul><li>Behavior - No longer wants to be with friends, play sports or participate in activities he or she once enjoyed.</li><li>Appetite - Not eating as much as normal or overeating.</li><li>Sleep habits - No longer sleeping through the night or has started wetting the bed again, even after they had previously stopped.</li></ul><p>If you see any of these behaviors in your child, consider approaching him or her with a casual, open-ended question like, &ldquo;I noticed this is happening. How are you feeling about that?&rdquo; If the child rebukes your effort or if the changes are impacting your child&rsquo;s quality of life, you may want to seek the help of a child behavioral health professional.</p><p><em>The&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Center for Behavioral Health</em></a><em>&nbsp;provides inpatient and outpatient consultation, evaluation and treatment for a full range of pediatric mental health conditions.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>In April, Hilaria Baldwin, wife of actor Alec Baldwin, shared painful news on Instagram that she was having a miscarriage. It isn&rsquo;t something most women talk about publicly, and it prompted news stories about this difficult topic.</p><p>Baldwin&rsquo;s story is one many women can relate to. About 10 to 15% of pregnancies end in miscarriage among women who know they&rsquo;re pregnant. That number rises to 40% if you include those who did not know they were pregnant yet.</p><p>&ldquo;It happens a lot more frequently than people think,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/obstetrician-and-gynecologist/dr-kendra-gillespie-md\">Kendra Gillespie, MD, an OB/GYN&nbsp;</a>who delivers at Baptist South <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-beaches\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>. &ldquo;Most miscarriages occur in the first trimester and are caused by a genetic abnormality that would make survival impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>But the numbers and facts don&rsquo;t assuage the feelings of profound loss. On top of that, many women experience shame and guilt, thinking they may have done something to cause the miscarriage.</p><p>&ldquo;Some women think it&rsquo;s something they did to cause the miscarriage &ndash; anything from exercise to having sex. I emphasize that it is not their fault. About half of all miscarriages happen due to chromosomal issues that no one can control,&rdquo; Dr. Gillespie said.</p><p>Chromosomal abnormalities can lead to a blighted ovum, where the embryo doesn&rsquo;t form or result in an embryo or fetus with no heartbeat. &nbsp;A phenomenon called molar pregnancy can also occur where chromosomal imbalances can lead to abnormal placental tissue, and a fetus may or may not develop.</p><p>Other reasons for miscarriage include:</p><ul><li><strong>A weakened cervix</strong>, in which the cervical muscles are too weak to hold the fetus. This can lead to a miscarriage in the second trimester.</li><li><strong>Anti-phospholipid syndrome</strong>, a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks tissue and cells in the body</li><li><strong>Long-term health conditions</strong> such as uncontrolled diabetes, thyroid disease or high blood pressure</li><li>Infections such as chlamydia or syphilis can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, commonly knowns as PID. This cause lead to an ectopic (outside of the uterus) pregnancy.</li><li><strong>Uterus abnormalities</strong> such as a uterine septum in which the uterus is partitioned into two compartments</li><li><strong>Food poisonin</strong><strong>g</strong>. Consuming contaminated foods can sometimes lead to miscarriage</li></ul><p>There are some factors within your control that may reduce your chances. &ldquo;Being healthy before you get pregnant reduces your risk factors,&rdquo; Dr. Gillespie said. &ldquo;All of those things you know you need to do &ndash; maintaining a &nbsp;healthy weight, exercising, not smoking and limiting alcohol are all very important.&rdquo;</p><p>Age, unfortunately, may play a role, too. &ldquo;As you get older, your risk of early miscarriage increases,&rdquo; Dr. Gillespie said. At 35, the chance is about 20%; by 40 it goes up to 40%.</p><p>Dr. Gillespie recommends having a preconception appointment with your OB/GYN to get all of your questions answered, go over your medical history and talk about lifestyle factors that could affect your ability to get and remain pregnant. A physical exam, along with a pelvic exam and a Pap smear are usually part of the visit.</p><p><strong>Physical healing after miscarriage</strong></p><p>There are differing opinions among OBs about when it&rsquo;s safe to try to become pregnant again. Some doctors feel it is safe to begin trying again after the first normal menstrual cycle if they&rsquo;ve had an early miscarriage without complications. Others recommend waiting up to six months if it occurred after the first trimester. It&rsquo;s best to check with your doctor to make the best decision for you.</p><p>&ldquo;Though the risk of having another miscarriage increases after the first, it is uncommon for it to occur repeatedly,&rdquo; said Dr. Gillespie. &ldquo;Most women go on to have normal pregnancies after a miscarriage.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Emotional healing after miscarriage</strong></p><p>&ldquo;The physical healing from a miscarriage can sometimes be easier than the emotional healing,&rdquo; said Julia Garrett, PsyD, a psychologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-behavioral-health\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a> who counsels women after they&rsquo;ve had a miscarriage. &ldquo;I tell my patients to take the time necessary to grieve the loss. No matter how far along the pregnancy, it is a significant loss.&rdquo;</p><p>Some people prefer to grieve by talking to a friend or relative, while others seek out grief counseling from a therapist or clergy person. Others find support groups where they can share feelings among other women in the same situation. &ldquo;Recognizing you&rsquo;re not alone in this experience can help reframe it,&rdquo; Dr. Garrett said.</p><p>Dr. Garrett provides patients with healthy ways to cope with the loss, such as engaging in active self-care. &ldquo;Set a goal to do something for yourself every day while you are going through the healing process. This can be taking time to read a book, exercise or meditate &ndash; any healthy activity where you are being kind to yourself.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>What to say or do</strong></p><p>Despite the prevalence of miscarriage, it&rsquo;s not something people usually talk about. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a cultural silence when it comes to miscarriage, which adds to a woman&rsquo;s feelings of loneliness and isolation,&rdquo; said Dr. Garrett.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel as if you have to avoid talking to the person about their loss. If you&rsquo;re comfortable, feel free to express your sorrow for their loss and then follow their lead &ndash; allowing them to talk if they like, or if you get the sense they&rsquo;d rather not talk, you can offer support,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Some ideas Dr. Garrett recommends include offering to help with routine chores, like folding laundry, cooking a meal, or watching kids. Even better, go ahead and provide an act of kindness -- like dropping off a meal &ndash; rather than asking, because many times people don&rsquo;t ask for help even when they need it.</p><p>Dr. Garrett said that some couples like to have a tangible way to remember their child, through activities like journaling, planting a memorial tree or creating a keepsake.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a right way or wrong way; the most important thing is to work through the feelings and give yourself the time you need,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><em>If you&rsquo;d like to talk to a therapist about miscarriage or other issues, call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-behavioral-health\"><em>Baptist Behavioral Health</em></a><em>&nbsp;at <strong>904.376.3800.</strong> If you&rsquo;re looking for an&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/pregnancy-and-childbirth\">OB/GYN</a> to help you manage your gynecologic health,&nbsp;</em><em>call <strong>904.202.4HER.</strong></em></p>",

It&rsquo;s a question long-debated with an answer long-awaited, especially by wine enthusiasts.</p><p>&ldquo;Studies have shown that red wine has benefits that can impact heart health,&rdquo; explained <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-ruple-galani-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ruple Galani, MD</a>, a cardiologist with Baptist Heart Specialists.</p><p>But don&rsquo;t sip too fast.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, the benefits from red wine for your heart are very small in the big scheme of things,&rdquo; said Dr. Galani. &ldquo;Healthy diet and exercise play the largest role in overall heart health.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The roar about your pour&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Resveratrol, a plant compound that acts like an antioxidant, is found in grape skin and thus red wine when the grape juice ferments to alcohol.</p><p>Red wine is shown to have more antioxidant power than white wine because grape skins, seeds and stems (the source of resveratrol) are preserved with the crushed red grapes to ferment.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Leg day, biceps, triceps, core &mdash; when you think about exercising your body&rsquo;s major muscle groups, these all come to mind first. But just as important is working out the pelvic floor. Not only does it support a number of important internal organs inside the body, but it&rsquo;s also a key part of pregnancy, delivery, and a woman&rsquo;s continence as she ages.</p><p>&ldquo;Pelvic floor muscles are the muscles that control the flow of the urine and bowel movements. When they are not strong enough, patients may experience incontinence, like stress incontinence, which occurs with coughing or sneezing, or urge incontinence. This comes with menopause, multiple childbirths, or connective tissue disease that can make the pelvic floor weak,&rdquo; said gynecologist <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/gynecologist/dr-paulami-guha-md\" target=\"_blank\">Paulami Guha, MD</a>, women&rsquo;s health specialist and surgeon at Baptist Health and North Florida Gynecology Specialists, LLC.</p><p>She said Kegels are just like any other exercise people do to tone a major muscle group, like lifting weights. Gynecologist <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/gynecologist/dr-maryellen-wechter-md\" target=\"_blank\">Maryellen Wechter, MD</a>, women&rsquo;s health specialist and surgeon at Baptist Health and North Florida Gynecology Specialists, LLC, said Kegels have another little-known benefit.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes, the problem with the pelvic floor isn&rsquo;t so much that it&rsquo;s weak, but that it&rsquo;s asymmetrically weak spasming in some part of the muscle. That can cause pain. We find in gynecology that pelvic floor therapy, and Kegels, if done correctly, can help treat pelvic pain,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>She also shares with her patients one easy technique to figure out if they&rsquo;re doing Kegels correctly.</p><p>&ldquo;Sit on the toilet and stop your urine &mdash; those are the muscles,&rdquo; said Dr. Wechter. &ldquo;That squeeze you do is the group of muscles you&rsquo;re trying to use during a Kegel exercise. I remind patients that these muscles are hard to control, so it takes a little bit of work to strengthen the mind-muscle connection, and concentration to not squeeze the belly or buttocks during that time.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Put Kegels on your to-do list</strong></p><p>The best way to remember to do Kegels each day is to associate them with a daily activity, like sitting on the couch to watch TV or read in the evenings.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need a special place to do Kegels,&rdquo; said Dr. Guha. &ldquo;They can be done even when you are sitting at the computer working or watching TV. We recommend doing them at least three times a day, 10 each time. You have to hold each one for at least five seconds.&rdquo;</p><p>In fact, your pelvic floor can take all the Kegels you&rsquo;re willing to do. Dr. Guha and Dr. Wechter agree that the pelvic floor can&rsquo;t get too strong, but recommend consulting with your gynecologist if Kegels cause any muscle spasms. That could be a sign of improper Kegel-ing or other issues that result in too much muscle tone.</p><p>They also say keeping up with Kegels isn&rsquo;t something they recommend only to women experiencing incontinence.</p><p>&ldquo;Doing Kegel exercises isn&rsquo;t just something to do when there&rsquo;s a problem, but something to do to help maintain those muscles for support of the organs and pleasure during intercourse,&rdquo; said Dr. Wechter. &ldquo;We like to see women do these throughout their lives. Once we see people with a problem, then you&rsquo;re working from the negative into the positive.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Men can do Kegels, too</strong></p><p>A recent study from the University of the West in the United Kingdom even found that Kegel exercises helped 40% of men with erectile dysfunction (ED) regain normal function. While it may not be the only treatment men need, Kegels probably can&rsquo;t hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;The pelvic floor is very similar between men and women, so there&rsquo;s probably no drawback to doing Kegels for men,&rdquo; said Dr. Wechter. &ldquo;As for how they help with ED, it&rsquo;s hard to find any good literature. For men to practice Kegels correctly, we would say squeeze the muscles you use when you try not to pass gas.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Guha adds that one of the most common risk factors for ED is the medications a man may be taking, and he doesn&rsquo;t have the major risk factors for pelvic floor weakness, like childbirth.</p><p><strong>How long does it take for Kegels to work?</strong></p><p>Women who have incontinence due to a weak pelvic floor and begin doing Kegels can expect to feel results in three to six months. Women with other reasons for incontinence, like a tumor or blockage, may require additional treatments and a little more time.</p><p>If there is no change, it may be time to get some expert guidance. Baptist Health&rsquo;s Total Control program is an evidence-based exercise program designed to strengthen the core and pelvic floor to help alleviate incontinence.</p><p>&ldquo;In some patients, the reason for pelvic pain is spasm of the muscles, similar to how a stress headache or jaw tightness can cause pain. Reverse Kegels, learned with a physical therapist, can help relax those muscles,&rdquo; Dr. Guha explained. &ldquo;After childbirth, even if you&rsquo;re not older, a woman will leak here and there and we tell them to wear a pad and do their Kegels.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you are experiencing incontinence or pelvic floor issues, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/4her-wellness-resources\" target=\"_blank\"><em>4Her</em></a><em>&nbsp;or call <a href=\"tel:1-904-202-4437\" target=\"_blank\">904-202-4HER (4437)</a> to find the right provider for you and make an appointment.</em></p>",

As a teenager, I experienced some OCD-like symptoms and was fortunate to receive treatment. When I became a psychologist, I became interested in helping others with it.&rdquo;</p><p>One of the most effective treatments for OCD is something called &ldquo;exposure with response prevention,&rdquo; or ERP, which looks at the underlying processes that may cause behavior changes.</p><p>According to a 2018 article in <em>Psychology Today,</em> ERP involves exposure to the feared stimuli and simultaneous prevention of a ritual, which is typically performed in the face of the anxiety-provoking obsession.</p><p>For instance, a patient challenges his or her obsession of contamination by touching sinks and communal door handles and then goes to eat without being allowed to wash up first. After eating, the patient realizes he or she did not become deathly ill and the fear is conquered.</p><p>In 2018, Eric Storch, PhD, an expert on ERP, led a two-day, 10-hour workshop on the treatment of pediatric OCD at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Expecting a baby is a joyous time for moms and dads as they prepare to welcome a new addition to the family. It&rsquo;s exciting to get ready for the arrival and understandably, the process of getting things in order can sometimes keep parents more focused on the upcoming event rather than the status quo. But for an existing child, chances are he or she may not be as excited about getting a new baby brother or sister. Someone else honing in on their action doesn&rsquo;t sound appealing &ndash; we all know how much children love to share, right?</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to be aware of this potential jealousy and to know how to handle it, said Terrie Andrews, PhD, a clinical psychologist and administrator for <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>. For a toddler between 2-and-3 years old, start a conversation with the goal of setting expectations about what a new baby needs, such as constant feedings, diaper changes, being held and lots of sleep time. Then explain that these were all things they required, too.</p><p>&ldquo;Turning the focus on the existing child and highlighting what it was like when he or she was a baby is a good place to start,&rdquo; said Dr. Andrews. &ldquo;Take this precious time to review their babyhood. Show pictures, reminisce about the baby shower and birth, and talk about the early years spent with family members.&rdquo;</p><p>A successful transition begins by being proactive, and these little sessions also allow you to spend some one-on-one time with your child before the baby comes. When the baby does arrive, ask family members to bring a small gift so he or she feels celebrated and included, too, and keep some on hand for times when visitors arrive with something just for the baby. And when you have get-togethers and parties that are soon to come, involve your older child as much as possible in the planning, as well as with helping with the baby. Suggest he or she help you by carrying the diaper bag or talking to the baby, or placing a call to the grandparents to tell them a story such as how they helped mom with the baby at bath time or at the store. &nbsp;</p><p>Children who are more attached to mom than to dad have a harder time with the adjustment and may begin to develop new behaviors like acting out. &ldquo;These negative behaviors can come in the form of tantrums, aggression toward the baby, and even regression such as baby talk, bedwetting and wanting to be coddled constantly,&rdquo; explained Dr. Andrews. &ldquo;This is fairly normal but if the behavior continues or escalates to the point where it&rsquo;s difficult for your family to manage, it might be time to see professional guidance.&rdquo;</p><p>Seeking help from family members, however, is something you shouldn&rsquo;t wait to do. Having an aunt, uncle or special grandparent take your older child on outings is advantageous and needed as this gives you a break and time to rest when the baby is sleeping. It also works the other way around &ndash; having family members care for the baby while you spend some time with your older child in the park, reading books or attending a birthday party. &nbsp;</p>",

For children in the hospital, life is anything but normal. But inside Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital are sanctuaries where kids can be, well, kids.<br><br>Six days a week, the nonprofit &ldquo;Art with a Heart in Healthcare&rdquo; transforms playrooms throughout Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital into art studios, safe spaces where a child can momentarily forget his or her illness or ailment. Art with a Heart has been working with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s for more than 17 years.<br><br>&ldquo;Art with a Heart is a fine art experience with trained artists in a health care environment,&rdquo; said Lori Presto, program director for Art with a Heart. &ldquo;We do gatherings where kids can work together with other kids or with family members, and we also do bedside visits.&rdquo;<br><br>Activities include origami, painting, sculpting with model clay, jewelry making and more.<br><br>&ldquo;I think patients can lose their identity sometimes,&rdquo; Presto said. &ldquo;They become the disease or illness they have, especially with some of the kids who are chronic. This helps them still feel like a kid and still be able to use their creativity, which I also think helps heal.&rdquo;<br><br>Inside one playroom, 12-year-old Aryanna Allgood painted a brightly colored sunset as her mother, Brittany Abriam, looked on.<br><br>&ldquo;Aryanna&rsquo;s face brightened up when she was told about the Art with a Heart program, and that she could come and make art,&rdquo; Abriam said. &ldquo;She brightened up considerably.&rdquo;<br><br><strong>Working together, for the children</strong><br>Artists with Art with a Heart work closely with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/patients/child-life\" target=\"_blank\">Child Life specialists</a>, professionals who use play therapeutically to help normalize the hospital experience for patients.<br><br>&ldquo;We do therapeutic activities to help children express what they&rsquo;re feeling inside and prepare them for the hospital experience,&rdquo; said Certified Child Life Specialist Christine Licsko, adding that children learn best through play. &ldquo;Their days can get bogged down with medical procedures, staff coming in and out of their rooms, and it&rsquo;s just an abnormal environment for them. So having an outlet like Art with a Heart or like Child Life to implement something that would be more normative in their day-to-day lives really helps them cope with the hospital experience.&rdquo;<br><br>Each piece of artwork is a positive memory to cling to when things get tough.<br><br>&ldquo;There are sad days, unfortunately,&rdquo; Licsko said. &ldquo;And to be able to see the children at their highest point, having a good time, doing an art project, that&rsquo;s everything to us.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Medicine can heal the body, but I think to heal the soul, you have to have art,&rdquo; Presto said.<br><br><em>If your child is in the hospital and you&rsquo;d like to contact&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/patients/child-life\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Child Life</em></a><em>, you can call&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://904-202-8541\" target=\"_blank\"><em>904.202.8541</em></a><em>.

Those forms you fill out before your doctor&rsquo;s appointment are full of questions because your responses help your doctor understand your health risks, history and needs.</p><p>&nbsp;And just like it&rsquo;s important to fill out your paperwork honestly, it&rsquo;s crucial for patients to be upfront with their physicians during their checkups.</p><p>A recent study published in the <em>JAMA Network Open</em> journal found that approximately 80% of patients aren&rsquo;t truthful with their doctors. <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-jamila-mainor-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jamila Mainor, MD</a>, a family physician with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a>, says she sometimes has patients who hesitate to tell her the whole truth during their appointments.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to tell exactly how common it is, but it does happen. Sometimes we can&rsquo;t tell initially, but on follow-up, it becomes more obvious and we try to figure out why,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>In her own experience, Dr. Mainor has found that patients have the most difficulty <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/wellness/embarrassing-health-question\" target=\"_blank\">opening up about sensitive subjects like sex and substance abuse</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely involving sexual health questions or concerns, a lot of patients may feel uncomfortable verbalizing what they&rsquo;re experiencing, like if the patient is concerned they may have a sexually transmitted disease,&rdquo; Dr. Mainor said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Also, they can be uncomfortable about their alcohol use or drug use, currently or in the past. It could have been 20 years ago and now they&rsquo;re doing very well but we still need to know about it.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s the harm if you&rsquo;re not honest?</strong></p><p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t have all the information, it&rsquo;s difficult to draw an accurate conclusion about the health concern they&rsquo;re having. Their condition could potentially get worse if they delay sharing an important piece of the puzzle,&rdquo; said Dr. Mainor. &ldquo;For example, I do have some patients who aren&rsquo;t honest about taking their medications, say for diabetes, and I would be concerned because their sugars are high. I ask them, &lsquo;Are you having any side effects from the medication? Is it too expensive? Has someone in your family had a negative experience with this medication?&rsquo; Asking them about some possible barriers usually helps them open up. Getting to the root of what&rsquo;s causing them not to be as compliant or honest with me helps us address it and move forward.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Mainor explained that if a patient stops taking their medication but doesn&rsquo;t share this information with his or her doctor, the physician may think the medication isn&rsquo;t working and prescribe a stronger dose. Then on a day the patient does take their medication, it could cause a negative outcome, such as more side effects than usual.</p><p>Study participants said their top reasons for not being truthful with their doctors included not wanting to feel judged, not wanting to be lectured, not wanting something potentially damaging to appear on their medical record, and not wanting to take up their doctor&rsquo;s time.</p><p>&ldquo;I completely understand that &mdash; I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be lectured either!&rdquo; said Dr. Mainor. &ldquo;For patients who feel they may be judged about their behaviors, especially if they are high-risk behaviors, I want them to feel comfortable sharing details they may not even share with their family, so if there is an issue, we can address it together. My job is to gather all the information I can and give them all the information I have, so together we can solve the problem. And a lot of that information we gather comes from the patient.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Is your health information really private?</strong></p><p>When it comes to concerns about medical records, Dr. Mainor assures her patients that patient privacy laws protect them from people, like employers or nosy family members, from accessing their records.</p><p>&ldquo;Their medical record is only used for medical purposes. But it&rsquo;s important to get all the information so another provider who treats them can access all the necessary information about the person. It could prevent them from accidentally doing that patient harm,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>But even if you&rsquo;re not ready to be completely honest, going to the doctor is always better than avoiding it altogether.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in a patient&rsquo;s best interest to be open and honest about their health history, family history, medications, and any high-risk behaviors,&rdquo; said Dr. Mainor. &ldquo;But without all of that, the doctor will still do his or her best. You can build up to that, just like with any relationship and for some people that&rsquo;s how it is with a doctor-patient relationship. Over time we want to build that relationship so they can open up.&rdquo; said Dr. Mainor.</p><p><em>To find a primary care doctor who supports you and whom you can trust, call </em><a href=\"tel:1-904-202-4968\" target=\"_blank\"><em>202-4YOU</em></a><em>&nbsp;to schedule an appointment with a </em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/primary-care\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Primary Care</em></a><em> physician.</em></p><p><em>Study:</em><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2716996\" target=\"_blank\"><em> jamanetwork.com</em></a></p>",

But don&rsquo;t fret &ndash; it&rsquo;s not as bad (or bizarre) as it may sound.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t knock the ear rocks</strong></p><p>Tiny crystals in your inner ear can dislodge and trigger benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), one of the most common types of vertigo. Typically, the dislodgement happens if you have struck your head or had an inner ear infection, but can also occur from repetitive movements that jostle the head (like on an exercise machine) or from lying in an inclined position for a while (like at the dentist).</p><p>&ldquo;Certain eye or head movements, such as looking over your shoulder or rolling over in bed, cause the loose crystals to move around inside the ear, which in turn causes symptoms such as dizziness or spinning, lightheadedness, imbalance and in some cases, nausea and vomiting,&rdquo; said Debbie Headley, PT, DPT, OSC, CLT, physical therapist and clinical manager for Baptist Rehabilitation Services Jacksonville.</p><p><strong>Vertigo? More like verti-NO</strong></p><p>BPPV is not a serious health issue and symptoms generally resolve after a brief time and with head stability. However, vertigo can be unpleasant and jarring, particularly if the episodes occur for more than a few weeks.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a non-invasive way to get the crystals back where they belong once your doctor has ruled out other causes of vertigo.</p><p>&ldquo;A trained professional such as a physical therapist or ear, nose and throat doctor can treat BPPV by performing a repositioning maneuver in an office setting,&rdquo; said Headley. &ldquo;The series of movements led by the provider move the crystals around the semi-circular interior of the ear and land back where they belong.&rdquo;</p><p>The treatment may require a few visits to be fully effective, and the provider may teach you how to perform the maneuver on your own at home.</p><p><em>Baptist Rehabilitation Services can help treat a variety of balance disorders, including BPPV.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>A fierce, award-winning fitness competitor, Nita Flores always considered herself the picture of health.</p><p>Besides having ongoing migraines since she was a teenager, she had no major complaints. So, when she started having headaches in November, the 42-year-old U.S. Navy officer thought she was having another migraine.</p><p>But over the next two days, the headaches became increasingly worse and medication was not helping.</p><p>&ldquo;I felt like someone had a hammer and was pounding my head. It literally felt like my head was going to explode,&rdquo; Flores said.</p><p>A CT scan in the emergency room revealed a severe brain bleed or hemorrhagic stroke caused by a rupture in a weakened blood vessel in the right side of her brain. She was transferred from a local hospital to Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville&rsquo;s Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center where she eventually needed surgery to remove the blood in her brain.</p><p>Similar to a blood clot in the leg, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-eric-sauvageau-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Sauvageau, MD</a>, neurovascular surgeon and co-director of the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/brain-and-spine/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-care\" target=\"_blank\">Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center</a>, said Flores had a clot in one of the main veins in her brain which caused the stroke. She was in a deep coma and on the verge of losing her life, Dr. Sauvageau said.</p><p>Because of the severity of the bleed and swelling in her brain, Dr. Sauvageau performed a decompressive hemicraniectomy where part of her skull was removed and later replaced in a follow-up surgery.</p><p>While she did not have typical stroke symptoms (sudden loss of balance, blurred vision, face drooping, arm drifts downward when raised and slurred speech), Dr. Sauvageau said a severe headache is also a sign of a stroke and medical attention should be sought.</p><p>One of only seven hospitals in the state certified as Comprehensive Stroke Center, the Baptist Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular multi-disciplinary team offers not only minimally invasive procedures but a full range of comprehensive treatment based on the patient&rsquo;s condition.</p><p>Flores&rsquo; stroke resulted in weakness on her left side, problems speaking and her peripheral vision was initially impacted. But today after months of speech, physical and occupational therapy with Brooks Rehabilitation, she is speaking clearly and on the mend.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s made an amazing recovery,&rdquo; Dr. Sauvageau said.</p><p>Prior to her stroke, Flores learned she was up for a promotion to lieutenant commander. Her teen daughters participated in the April ceremony and she is back to work part-time. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s also a few classes away from receiving her Master of Science in Nursing.</p><p>Flores, who was born and raised in Haiti and in the U.S. Navy for 20 years, said she&rsquo;s blessed for all the medical professionals that assisted in her care, including Dr. Sauvageau, the nurses and team at Baptist Jacksonville.</p><p>&ldquo;My whole life changed in a matter of days,&rdquo; added Flores, who works out several times a week and was preparing to compete in a muscle and fitness competition after winning similar competitions in Spain and Italy.</p><p>&nbsp;She encourages others not to take any symptoms lightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Just because you are healthy or had migraines in the past, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s a normal migraine. You have to seek medical care &ndash; the sooner, the better,&rdquo; Flores said. &ldquo;The last thing I expected was to have a stroke. It just shows you how a stroke is not something we can underestimate. It can be very debilitating and it happens so fast.&rdquo;</p><p><em>May is National Stroke Awareness Month.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>It&rsquo;s the topic dominating conversations in online forums and parenting groups. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 1,250 measles cases confirmed nationwide as of October 2019.<br><br>Duval County, Florida, now joins the list of places where there has been a confirmed case. In addition to the October 2019 case in Jacksonville, there were two measles cases reported in Florida in April. None of the cases had documented vaccinations.<br><br>With all the buzz surrounding measles, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatrician/dr-matt-paton-md\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Paton, MD</a>, a pediatrician with Baptist Pediatrics, answered some of the most common questions he gets from parents.<br><br><strong>What is measles?</strong><br>Measles is a highly contagious, viral illness that occurs worldwide. It was considered eradicated from the United States in 2000, but has made a resurgence over the last several years. Symptoms consist of fever, malaise (feeling really bad), runny nose, cough and conjunctivitis (pink eye). After several days, patients break out in a rash starting on the face and chest and spreading outward.</p><p><strong>How do I keep my kids safe?</strong><br>The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was responsible for the eradication of measles from the United States. It has repeatedly been shown to be both highly effective and extremely safe in keeping children protected. Children are recommended to have the first dose of the vaccine after their first birthday, and a second dose after the age of 4. Avoiding travel to areas where there are outbreaks, and ensuring close friends and family members are protected against measles, will help decrease your child&rsquo;s chances of getting exposed.</p><p><strong>How do I know if I am protected against measles?&nbsp;</strong><br>People immunized as a child with a live vaccine, like the MMR, are considered protected for life. People born before 1957, due to widespread exposure to measles before there was a vaccine, are also considered protected due to natural immunity. If adults are unsure about their immunization status, there is a blood test to evaluate whether they are immune to all three components of the MMR vaccine. Receiving the vaccine as an adult is also both safe and effective. Parents should definitely be vaccinated against measles. Infants in the United States generally are not immunized with the MMR vaccine until his or her first birthday and therefore are unprotected until that time. Because parents spend more time outside the home and interacting with other people, they are at greater risk of being exposed to the measles. If parents are not immune to measles, their likelihood of getting sick themselves and subsequently spreading it to their children is very high. If adults are interested in checking their immunization status, they should discuss that with their primary care physician.</p><p><strong>We are traveling overseas. Do we need to take any extra precautions for potential measles exposure?</strong><br>Traveling overseas with family can potentially expose you to the risk of multiple different infections. In the United States, MMR vaccination is recommended after 12 months of age, but for children traveling to potential areas of measles exposure, the MMR vaccine is recommended for a child as young as 6 months of age. This would not count for the child&rsquo;s primary series but is important for him or her to receive immune protection prior to the first birthday. These children would still need to receive a dose after their first birthday, and again after 4 years of age.</p><p><strong>If measles was declared eradicated in 2000, how is the disease back?</strong><br>There have been a significant number of outbreaks across the world in areas that are frequented by American travelers. These travelers get exposed and bring the disease back to the United States. The virus is able to &ldquo;take hold&rdquo; in areas of decreased immunization practices, leading to significant outbreaks in our country. A small percentage of immunized individuals are also susceptible, as well as children and adults with medical contraindications to MMR immunization.<br><br><em>Your child&rsquo;s pediatrician &ndash; and your own primary care physician &ndash; can help answer additional questions and address concerns you may have about measles and the MMR vaccine.

The study looked at more than 83,000 women in California and Georgia diagnosed with breast cancer and ovarian cancer.</p><p>The findings, published in April 2019 in the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em>, also found that 15 % of the ovarian cancer patients and 8% of breast cancer patients who did receive genetic testing were found to have inherited gene mutations which warranted changes in their treatment plan.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/gynecologic-oncologist/dr-jenny-whitworth-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jenny Whitworth, MD</a>, a gynecologic oncologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>, said results of studies in the past year have physicians stressing the importance of genetic testing, which involves a blood test or cheek swab.</p><p>The benefits include:</p><ol><li><strong>K</strong><strong>nowing how to proceed with the right treatment</strong>. Some medications are geared toward cancers with gene mutations.</li><li><strong>Preventing future cancers</strong>. A person with a gene mutation for breast cancer is at higher risk for ovarian cancer and a person with ovarian cancer is at higher risk for breast cancer. Screenings and other steps such as surgery can be taken.</li><li><strong>Allowing a child whose parent carries the gene to take preventative action such as surgery, which significantly reduces their risk</strong>. First-degree relatives, male or female, have a 50% chance of having the same mutation.</li></ol><p>&ldquo;We have really good evidence that knowing this information could impact your life,&rdquo; Dr. Whitworth said. &ldquo;You can be proactive about your health especially people with early ovarian stage cancer. You have a chance to intervene in preventing breast cancer.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Whitworth said sometimes people don&rsquo;t get tested because they don&rsquo;t have children and don&rsquo;t realize that it&rsquo;s still important to their treatment and future care. And, if they do have children, they delay testing because they may feel a sense of guilt of passing on the gene mutation.</p><p><strong>Knowing the answer is essential</strong></p><p>Another national study last fall found that patients testing positive for the gene mutation, BRCA1 and BRCA2, benefit from new medication known as PARP inhibitors after surgery and chemotherapy. Based on the study, Dr. Whitworth said 70 percent of women are still in remission three years later compared to 25% without the medication.</p><p>&ldquo;The secret is trying to keep patients in remission.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>When asked to describe her son, Michael, Kathleen Scheibe can&rsquo;t find the words. But after thinking it through, one sentence sums up the 16-year-old: he has a big heart.<br><br>Michael Scheibe&rsquo;s story has revolved around his heart since before he took his first breath. It began the moment Kathleen had her 20-week sonogram and found out she and her husband, Ray, were having a boy. It was welcome news &ndash; they already had a daughter, Kaitlyn, and a baby boy would only make their family complete.<br><br>But after the sonographer left the room, the doctor entered with what Kathleen recognized to be a grim look. Something was wrong with Michael&rsquo;s heart. Initial tests gave him a 50% chance of making it to birth.<br><br>&ldquo;I just collapsed in my Ray&rsquo;s arms,&rdquo; said Kathleen. &ldquo;And for the next three days, I didn&rsquo;t move off the couch. I really went numb.&rdquo;<br><br>Throughout Kathleen&rsquo;s pregnancy, Michael&rsquo;s chances of survival improved. She delivered at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville via cesarean section and was able to get one look at baby Michael before he was whisked away to the Neonatal ICU at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. The heart defect Michael was born with is called double-outlet right ventricle. It causes the mixing of red, oxygen-rich blood and blue, oxygen-poor blood. Michael also had muscular obstruction below his pulmonary valve.<br><br>All things considered, baby Michael was doing well and was able to go home shortly after he was born.<br><br>The Scheibes were warned that Michael would have so-called &ldquo;blue spells&rdquo; &ndash; instances where his heart wasn&rsquo;t able to circulate blood to the body.<br><br>&ldquo;Once that happened, we were to push his legs to his chest and bear-hug him to force the blood to go through to places that it needed to go,&rdquo; Kathleen said. If the blue spells lasted more than five minutes, they were to call 911. Thankfully, that never happened, but by the time Michael was 10 months old, the blue spells were happening twice daily.<br><br>One month later, at just 11 months old, Michael had his first open-heart surgery.<br><br>&ldquo;When I handed him over, I know my knees buckled,&rdquo; said Kathleen. &ldquo;My husband was literally holding me up because I was terrified.&rdquo;<br><br><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatric-cardiothoracic-surgeon/dr-eric-ceithaml-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Ceithaml, MD</a>, a pediatric cardiovascular surgeon at <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>, performed the surgery. Dr. Ceithaml said Wolfson Children&rsquo;s sees between five and 10 cases of Michael&rsquo;s particular congenital heart defect each year.<br><br>&ldquo;We had to go in and cut out that obstructing muscle, close the hole in the heart, take out the thickened pulmonary valve, and then put a patch on that area,&rdquo; said Dr. Ceithaml.<br><br>A few years later, when Michael was 4, he developed an arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. In Michael&rsquo;s case it beat too quickly. He had his second open-heart procedure, also performed by Dr. Ceithaml, when he was 6.<br><br>During the second procedure, Dr. Ceithaml put in a bioprosthetic valve to replace the pulmonary valve that had been removed years earlier, and froze the area of the heart that was causing the heart to beat too fast.<br><br>In total, Michael has had six heart procedures, including the two open-heart surgeries. Kathleen is careful to call each one a repair, not a fix.<br><br>&ldquo;This is a lifetime thing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to need the valve taken care of for the rest of his life.&rdquo;<br><br>Kathleen is grateful for the care she, Michael and the whole family have received from &nbsp;Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital since before Michael was born, allowing him to live the life of a relatively normal teenager. Michael now plays the trumpet in his high school marching band, but Kathleen said what really defines him is his compassion for those in need and his willingness to give second chances.<br><br>What really defines him is his heart.<br><br>&ldquo;I am so willing to share Michael&rsquo;s story because it&rsquo;s a story of hope,&rdquo; said Kathleen.<br><br><em>Michael was selected as an ambassador for the <a href=\"https://foundation.baptistjax.com/basstournament\" target=\"_blank\">30th Annual Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital Bass Tournament</a> because his story represents where the funds will go in 2019: the hospital&rsquo;s heart surgery program and the new partnership with UPMC Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Pittsburgh.

It&rsquo;s a time of emerging from the dark and dreary winter and jumping forward to days of more sunlight and warmer temperatures.</p><p>With this crawl out of hibernation, people often talk about spring cleaning, dusting off the proverbial cobwebs that may have accumulated during the winter months. We can take the spring clean mentality and relate it to our personal well-being. The New Year oftentimes gets all the recognition as the ideal time to tackle new health habits and improve your wellness, but why not make your personal health the focus year round?</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to spring clean your health this season, take a look at some of the areas of personal wellness and see where you might like to take a start.</p><ul><li>Social wellness includes maintaining good relationships, caring for others and letting others care for you, and contributing to your community. To focus on this area you may try to prioritize your schedule to make time for social activities you enjoy.&nbsp;</li><li>Emotional wellness focuses on understanding and respecting your feelings and those of others. A big part of this area is being equipped to deal with the varying human emotions. It&rsquo;s not always easy, and sometimes you may need help from trusted confidants or licensed professionals, like those at Baptist Behavioral Health.</li><li>Intellectual wellness encourages us to engage in creative and mentally stimulating activities. Learn a new language, pick up a hobby, read, or write&mdash;the options are endless!</li><li>The Spiritual wellness element can be the most personal piece of the puzzle. This area is rooted in personal values, beliefs, and purpose. If this is an area you are looking to focus on, try by starting to identify your &ldquo;why&rdquo;.</li><li>Financial wellness may look completely different when looking person to person, but in a nutshell, this area includes managing your resources, making informed spending decisions and setting realistic goals. Want to start here? Get an idea of your monthly expenses and then formalize a budget.</li><li>Physical wellness is often the dimension of personal wellbeing that most think about when we talk about health and wellness. This focus includes caring for your body to stay healthy now and in the future. The best way to do this?

I cannot stress this enough.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Studies suggest new links</strong></p><p>Some recent studies suggest possible new risk factors to kidney cancer, including kidney stones and diuretics used to treat high blood pressure.</p><p>A study in the <em>British Journal of Cance</em><em>r</em> by Dutch researchers who followed almost 5,000 patients over two decades showed an increased risk of kidney cancer in people with a history of kidney stones and especially those who were diagnosed with kidney stones before the age of 40.</p><p>But even the authors of the study stressed that more research is needed.</p><p>Dr. Melquist, who specializes in kidney, bladder, prostate, ureter and testicular cancers, said the correlation in studies he&rsquo;s seen regarding kidney stones is small and the cancer is a rare form of kidney cancer.</p><p>Preventing stones from forming in the first place is key. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Staying well hydrated, especially in Florida, reduces the chance of stones and keeps your kidneys properly flushed,&rdquo; Dr. Melquist said.</p><p>Try drinking more than 2 liters of fluid a day and ensuring your urine is clear to light yellow so you know you are getting enough fluids.</p><p>Studies suggesting a correlation between diuretics and kidney cancer have also had patients asking questions.</p><p>But Dr. Melquist said the benefit of treating hypertension to prevent stroke and cardiovascular deaths far outweighs any risk of kidney cancer.</p><p>&ldquo;Generally speaking, you should view studies with caution. If you have concerns or questions you read about studies online, you should bring them up with your primary care physician or specialist,&rdquo; Dr. Melquist said.</p><p>Even though it is a relatively uncommon disease, kidney cancer is:</p><ul><li>One of the 10 most common cancers in the U.S., but not common enough for routine screenings. Renal cell carcinoma, which forms in the small tubes of the kidneys, makes up about 90% of all cases.</li><li>The American Cancer Society estimates 73,820 new cases of kidney and renal pelvis cancers will occur this year -- 44,120 men and 29,700 women.</li><li>The average age of people when they are diagnosed is 64.</li><li>The lifetime risk for developing kidney cancer is 1 in 48 for men and 1 in 83 for women.</li></ul><p>Some common risk factors include:</p><ul><li>Smoking</li><li>Obesity</li><li>Family history of kidney cancer</li><li>High blood pressure</li><li>Advanced kidney disease</li><li>Long-term misuse of pain medications</li></ul><p>Exposure to substances in the workplace such as certain metals, herbicides and organic solvents such as trichloroethylene can also be risk factors. Genetic and hereditary conditions can cause an increased risk, including von Hippel-Lindau disease (a condition resulting in tumors and cysts in different parts of the body), and tuberous sclerosis (benign tumors in the body), to name a few.</p><p><strong>Staying healthy is the best defense</strong></p><p>Dr. Melquist points to a phrase by Mark A. Moyad, MD, with the University of Michigan Medical Center, that &ldquo;heart-healthy is all healthy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you do the things that keep your heart healthy, you are doing your body a wealth of good, including your kidneys,&rdquo; Dr. Melquist said.</p><p>While blood in the urine and flank pain between the back and upper abdomen can signify a concern with your kidneys, most kidney cancers are detected by chance when a person is getting a CT scan because of other issues.</p><p>When an individual is diagnosed with kidney cancer, treatment can range from removal of the mass or kidney to cryotherapy to freeze and destroy the cancer cells.</p><p>&ldquo;If you can contain it, there is a very high success rate.

It&rsquo;s about knowing how a well-rounded diet can positively impact your health, reducing your overall cancer risk.</p><p>Dr. Crozier has some quick tips for incorporating fruits and vegetables into your diet:</p><ul><li>Choose vegetables and fruits instead of calorie-dense foods like fries, chips and donuts.</li><li>Include fruits and vegetables at every meal of the day, ensuring you eat the recommended 2-&frac12; cups of fruits and vegetables daily.</li><li>Choose 100% juice if you drink vegetable or fruit juices.</li><li>When eating your fruits and vegetables, limit your intake of creamy sauces, dressings and dips.</li></ul><p>In a study of 3,000 post-menopausal women, those who consumed 25 or more servings of vegetables weekly had a 37% lower risk of breast cancer compared with women who consumed fewer than nine vegetable servings weekly<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables helps reduce cancer risk and bonus, it&rsquo;s also associated with a decreased risk of high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.

The top 15 foods with the least pesticides are called the &ldquo;Clean 15&rdquo; and the 12 foods with the most pesticides are called the &rdquo;Dirty Dozen.&rdquo; Take this list to the supermarket to know when to buy organic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Supermarket mania&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Once you&rsquo;re past the produce, you&rsquo;ll still face many choices for a healthier diet.</p><ul><li><strong>Smart carbs.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Grains are divided into two subgroups &ndash; whole grains and refined grains. Refined grains are milled, a process that removes dietary fiber, iron and B vitamins. Therefore, it&rsquo;s best to choose whole-grain foods like whole-grain bread, pasta and cereals (barley and oats).</p><ul><li><strong>Mighty meats.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Limit red meat and processed meats like bacon, sausage, lunch meats and hotdogs. &ldquo;Fish, poultry and beans are great alternatives to red meat,&rdquo; explained Dr. Crozier. &ldquo;When choosing red meat, select lean cuts and smaller portions.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>For all meat, poultry and fish, Dr. Crozier recommends baking, broiling or poaching rather than frying or charbroiling.</p><p>According to a recent study, women eating 1.75 ounces of processed meat daily increased the risk of breast cancer by 64% in postmenopausal women compared to women who did not eat meat<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>A different study in the UK revealed people who ate 76 grams of red and processed meat per day (that&rsquo;s about the size of one burger) had a 20% higher chance of developing colorectal cancer compared to those who only ate 21 grams per day<sup>3</sup>.</p><ul><li><strong>Avoiding alcohol.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Skip the wine cooler and even the red wine! More than 100 studies have evaluated the association between alcohol consumption and risk of breast cancer. A meta-analysis of 53 of these studies (including 58,000 women with breast cancer) showed that women who drank more than about three alcoholic drinks per day had a 1.5 times increased risk of developing breast cancer when compared to nondrinkers<sup>4</sup>.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re choosing to drink alcohol, the recommendation is no more than one drink per day for women or two drinks per day for men.</p><ul><li><strong>Shrinking sugar.&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;High-sugar foods are usually highly processed and refined, low in nutrient value and also low in dietary fiber,&rdquo; said Dr. Crozier. &ldquo;In addition, these foods appear to increase serum insulin and serum insulin-like growth factor levels, which stimulate cancer cell growth.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Limiting your intake of sugar-sweetened beverages such as soft drinks, sports drinks and fruit-flavored drinks is a quick way to reduce your sugar consumption significantly.</p><p>It&rsquo;s true: superfoods are super to add to your well-rounded diet, one controllable risk factor when it comes to cancer. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to get screened, stay physically active and maintain a healthy weight,&rdquo; reminded Dr. Crozier. &ldquo;In addition to your diet, there are many factors in your control and all of them contribute to reducing cancer risk.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/y-healthy-living-centers\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Y Healthy Living Centers</em></a><em>&nbsp;bring medically integrated programs from Baptist Health into the Y.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>One of the greatest feelings for a parent is to cradle their newborn baby and feel their heartbeat.</p><p>But when their baby is hooked up to machines and tubes in the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/newborn\" target=\"_blank\">Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)&nbsp;</a>fighting to survive, the wait to hold their baby can be frustrating.</p><p>There is a way to still have that connection.</p><p>Skin-to-skin care, also known as &ldquo;kangaroo care,&rdquo; allows parents to hold their premature babies close to their bare chest. This practice provides benefits for the baby and their parents. Starting originally in the late 70s in Bogota, Colombia, where the death rate for premature infants was 70%, babies receiving kangaroo care not only survived but thrived.</p><p>&ldquo;Parents have the opportunity to provide this very important care. It&rsquo;s calming and allows for parent-infant bonding,&rdquo; said Sara Gravelle, NICU care manager for <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.com\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>. &ldquo;We are in a very high-tech environment. This activity of holding your baby skin-to-skin can be as important as the medical interventions we provide.&rdquo;</p><p>Kangaroo care can start as early as 30 weeks in newborns who have stable vital signs and temperatures with few episodes of apnea, a serious sleep disorder resulting in an interruption in breathing.</p><p>Heat and the moisture from feeling direct skin-to-skin contact and not having clothing in between allow for good conduction of heat. A warm blanket and hat are also placed over the baby.</p><p>Numerous studies show physiologic and developmental benefits for the infant, including:</p><ul><li>Regulating temperature</li><li>Calming</li><li>Improving sleep patterns</li><li>Improving growth and development</li><li>Providing parent-child bonding</li><li>Increasing milk supply in the mother</li><li>Promoting early initiation of breastfeeding</li><li>Reducing the mother&rsquo;s anxiety and even depression</li></ul><p>A Harvard University study analyzing more than 100 previous studies found skin-to-skin care reduced mortality by 36 percent and major infections by 47 percent.</p><p>Parents also feel more attached to their infants and feel an increase in their parental role.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not uncommon for parents to feel a little detached since they can&rsquo;t do a lot of hands-on care when their baby is in the NICU. This is a first step to really knowing their baby, feeling their heartbeat and feeling their baby relax in their care, which is so critical to the success of going home,&rdquo; Gravelle added.</p><p>Even stable babies on ventilators can have this opportunity with help from the care team.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really meaningful for both staff and families,&rdquo; Gravelle said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard because parents have delivered their baby and then must give up control. This is a critical time when parents can hold their baby and do something we can&rsquo;t do for their baby. There is a closeness and comfort for the parents and the baby.&rdquo;</p><p>For skin-to-skin care to be successful, parents should shower before their visit, avoid perfumes and strongly scented deodorant, refrain from smoking since infants are sensitive to secondhand smoke, and wear a button-down shirt or stretchy top similar to a tube top.</p><p>At the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital NICUs, parents can sit with their baby at least 60 minutes daily.</p><p><em>May 15, 2019, is International Kangaroo Care Day, a global event raising awareness of skin-to-skin contact. Wolfson Children&rsquo;s multidisciplinary team will celebrate by distributing educational materials and pins to encourage parents to ask and get involved in this type of care.</em></p>",

When paramedics arrived at her home that day in late December 2016, they asked her to raise both of her arms. She could only raise one.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Sissy\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1556297227/Juice/Ketterman_190412_1176Juice2nd.jpg\"></div><p>&ldquo;I knew what that meant. I was having an<a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/health-library/videos/ischemic-stroke\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;ischemic stroke</a>,&rdquo; said Horn, who was rushed to the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-center\" target=\"_blank\">Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center</a> at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>, one of only seven hospitals in the state certified as a Comprehensive Stroke Center by The Joint Commission and the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.</p><p>To be eligible, hospitals must have advanced imaging capabilities, 24/7 availability of specialized treatments, and provide physician assistants, nurses and other staff with unique education and training to care for complex stroke patients.</p><p>On the way to the emergency room, a paramedic told Horn a stroke team, including Baptist nursing professionals with advanced practice skills, would be waiting for her when she arrived at the emergency room.</p><p>&ldquo;When he said that, I was thinking, &lsquo;Yeah right.&rsquo; But, sure enough, when I got to the ER, a whole team of people was waiting to take care of me,&rdquo; Horn recalled.</p><p><strong>Less invasive surgery</strong></p><p>Ischemic stroke patients who arrive at Baptist Health emergency departments within four-and-a-half hours of symptom onset receive a clot-busting medication known as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to reverse the negative effects of a stroke. But because Horn couldn&rsquo;t determine exactly when her symptoms started, endovascular neurosurgery was the next best option to dissolve a blood clot clogging a main vessel in her brain.</p><p>Endovascular neurosurgery is less invasive than traditional vascular surgery and involves a needle puncture, not an incision, at the surgery site. Horn was part of a multi-center, international clinical trial called COMPASS, which involved direct-aspiration stroke treatment approach versus the conventional stent retriever approach.</p><p>Endovascular neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-ricardo-hanel-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ricardo Hanel</a>, MD, PhD, co-director of the Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center, performed Horn&rsquo;s interventional treatment by making a small incision in the groin and then passing a soft microcatheter into her blocked vessel. The vacuum-like device literally sucked out the blood clot as opposed to retrieving it with a stent device.</p><p>The surgical procedure took only 20 minutes.</p><p>&ldquo;While tPA still remains the first line of therapy for ischemic stroke, it&rsquo;s generally not an option for patients like Mrs. Horn who go to bed well and at some point during the night have a stroke,&rdquo; Dr. Hanel said. &ldquo;If someone is administered tPA beyond four and a half hours, the odds of improving are much lower.</p><p>&ldquo;Having ongoing clinical trials at Baptist allows us to be on the cutting edge of new concepts, techniques and technologies. What that means for the patient is they have first-hand access to the latest technology, oftentimes before anyone else in the country.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/patient-info/baptist-research-institute\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health Research Institute</a> is currently enrolling patients in two clinical trials (TIMELESS and ESCAPE) that are extending the time window in which a stroke patient could benefit from a new clot-busting pharmaceutical solution -- even up to 24 hours after the patient was last known to be well.</p><p><strong>Right people in her path</strong></p><p>&nbsp;A few hours after her surgery, Horn was sitting up in bed in Baptist Jacksonville&rsquo;s Neuro-intensive Care Unit surrounded by her family. Strength to the left side of her body had been completely restored. She walked out of the hospital two days later.</p><p>From the time she arrived at the Baptist ER to the time the blood clot was removed, only 58 minutes had elapsed.</p><p>&quot;It&rsquo;s truly amazing what they can do these days,&rdquo; said Horn, who was born and raised in Jacksonville.</p><p>&ldquo;Before I had my stroke, I didn&rsquo;t even know the Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center existed in my town. It made a huge difference. I thank God for putting the right people in my path.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>BE FAST</em>&nbsp;</strong><em>and CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY if you observe any sign of a stroke.

The most common causes of injury were (in order): trampolines, monkey bars or jungle gyms (climbers), slides and swings.</p><p>According to Safe Kids Worldwide, falls are the most common playground injury, accounting for more than 75% of all playground-related injuries. Additionally, lack of or improper supervision is associated with around 45% of playground injuries.</p><p>Often times, a situation turns from harmless to dangerous in seconds.</p><p>&ldquo;One time, I walked out into my backyard, and my then-10-year-old son was walking across the top beam of the swing set,&rdquo; Dennis said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of thing kids do.&rdquo; She added that her daughter&rsquo;s only broken bone was caused by a fall from a swing, and her own first trip to the emergency department as a child was from a see-saw accident.</p><p>While the numbers can be scary, Dennis said playgrounds are still vital for a child&rsquo;s development.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want kids to miss out on building strength, coordination and confidence,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We just have to be smart about it.&rdquo;</p><p>Parents and caregivers should keep these tips in mind before the next trip to the playground:</p><ul><li><strong>Actively supervise kids on playground equipment.&nbsp;</strong>Simply being present is not enough. Avoid things that will distract your attention from your child, like a cell phone or too much socializing with other parents.</li><li><strong>Check the playground for hazards like rusted or broken equipment and dangerous surfaces.</strong> Report any hazards to the school or appropriate local office.</li><li><strong>Teach children that pushing, shoving or crowding while on the playground can be dangerous.</strong></li><li><strong>Dress appropriately.</strong> Remove jewelry, scarves and clothing with drawstrings that could get caught on equipment, posing a strangulation hazard. If a child bikes to the playground, be sure he/she removes his/her helmet before getting on any equipment.</li><li><strong>Seek out playgrounds with play areas separated by age.</strong></li><li><strong>Ensure safe surfacing beneath and surrounding playground equipment.</strong> Avoid playgrounds with non-impact absorbing surfaces like asphalt, concrete, grass, dirt or gravel. Look for playgrounds with sand, pea gravel, wood chips, mulch and shredded rubber. Rubber mats, synthetic turf and other artificial materials are also safe surfaces.</li><li><strong>Surfacing should be at least 12 inches deep and extend at least 6 feet in all directions around stationary equipment.</strong> For swings, surfacing should extend in the back and front, twice the height of the suspending bar.</li><li><strong>Check that all playgrounds are inspected and maintained by qualified personnel.</strong> Double check with school and child care centers to make sure the playgrounds are regularly inspected and to find out when the last inspection was.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/safe-kids-northeast-florida\" target=\"_blank\"><em>THE PLAYERS Center for Child Health</em></a><em>&nbsp;at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital provides child injury prevention information through Safe Kids Northeast Florida.

April is Distracted Driving Awareness Month, a good time for parents to try the following tips from Safe Kids Worldwide:</p><ul><li><strong>Set a good example for your children by refraining from texting while driving, yourself.</strong> Try putting your phone in the back seat or somewhere else out of reach so you won&rsquo;t be tempted to grab it.</li><li><strong>Resist the urge to call or text your children when you know they will be driving.</strong> It&rsquo;s natural to want to check in, but wait until enough time has passed for them to get to their destination or set a designated time for them to call you.</li><li><strong>Set ground rules for your children when they start to drive.&nbsp;</strong>You may even consider a contract or other agreement in which the kids vow not to use their phone while driving.</li><li><strong>Brainstorm ways your child feels comfortable addressing their friends if they see them texting while driving.</strong> Offering a simple &ldquo;Do you want me to check that for you?&rdquo; could avert disaster.</li><li><strong>Encourage seat belt use.</strong> This protects your child and others in the car; an unrestrained person can injure others during a crash.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/child-advocacy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>THE PLAYERS Center for Child Health</em></a><em>&nbsp;at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital promotes safe and healthy childhoods for all kids, offering a wide range of advocacy programs from injury prevention to access to health care.<br></em><br><em>Sources: <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving\" target=\"_blank\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>,&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/distracted_driving/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"https://www.safekids.org/safetytips/field_risks/teen-drivers?utm_campaign=Teen%20Drivers&utm_source=email-newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Top-Tips---April-11-Teen-Drivers\" target=\"_blank\">Safe Kids Worldwide</a>.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>More than a third of American adults are not getting enough sleep on a regular basis, according to a 2016 study by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.</p><p>People with transient or short-term insomnia often reach for over-the-counter and prescription sleep aids that have a sedating effect and are generally safe.</p><p>But recent studies raise the likelihood that some popular sleep aids that contain an antihistamine may be associated with increased dementia risk. The studies are focused on a class of drugs called &ldquo;anticholinergic&rdquo; that block a chemical in the brain involved in memory and learning.</p><p>People commonly use sleep aids that contain the anticholinergic drug diphenhydramine (think Benadryl and Dramamine). While safe to use, taking them for an extended time could significantly impact your risk of developing dementia.</p><p>&ldquo;Just because it&rsquo;s an over-the-counter medication doesn&rsquo;t mean it is safe and free from interactions,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/geriatrician/dr-raphael-balbino-md\" target=\"_blank\">Raphael Balbino</a>, MD, a family medicine physician and geriatrician with the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/geriatric-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist AgeWell Center for Senior Health</a> who specializes in dementia and managing multiple medications.</p><p>&ldquo;When I discuss with my patients that there are safer alternatives to help them sleep and that sleep aids can increase the risk of dementia in the future and for older adults, even the risk of delirium, most of them are open to working with me to switch from that medication.<br><br>&ldquo;In fact, in some cases, patients have shown marked improvement in their reasoning after they stop taking these sleep aids,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>One study found that long-term use (three years or more) of anticholinergic sleep aids and allergy medication increased the risk of dementia.</p><p>These recent findings don&rsquo;t mean people should stop taking medication because they are concerned about developing dementia. Always consult your physician before stopping any prescribed medication. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to review the medications you are taking with your physician before making any changes.</p><p>There are a number of natural sleep remedies that can be used as a substitute. Even foods high in melatonin, such as bananas, ginger and red cherries, can be consumed before bedtime to help induce sleepiness.</p><p>Natural allergy remedies also include a charcoal/HEPA filter for your home and even the use of essential oils in a diffuser such as Eucalyptus oil.</p><p>&ldquo;For most cases of allergies, the non-drowsy antihistamines and the nasal steroid sprays are enough to help with symptoms,&rdquo; said Dr. Balbino.</p><p>The best way to reduce your risk for dementia is by not smoking, getting regular exercise and sticking to a healthy diet rich in fiber, fruits, vegetables and omega-3 fatty acids.</p><p><em>If you are having trouble sleeping, talk to your <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">primary care doctor</a>.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>The tragic news about a 10-year-old Kentucky boy who took his life because he was bullied at school is unfathomable. Childhood is supposed to be a care-free time in life.</p><p>Unfortunately, suicide is the second-leading cause of death for people between the ages of 10 and 34, according to Centers for Disease Control.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not something you hear about often, but it happens more than you would think,&rdquo; said Jessica Winberry, health educator for <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/child-advocacy\">The PLAYERS Center for Child Health at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital&nbsp;</a>and an instructor for Youth Mental Health First Aid.</p><p>The causes are not easy to pinpoint. &ldquo;Suicidal behavior is complicated and rarely the result of a single issue,&rdquo; said Winberry.</p><p><strong>Who&rsquo;s at risk?</strong><br>Mental health issues that can lead to suicidal behavior typically develop in adolescence. Winberry said one of the biggest precursors is experiencing a traumatic event. &ldquo;It may not seem significant to others, but if the person perceives the event as traumatic, it can have a negative and lasting effect on mental health.&rdquo;</p><p>There are many other suicide risk factors, including:</p><ul><li>Family history of depression or suicide</li><li>Sexual and gender identity issues</li><li>Low self-esteem</li><li>Academic struggles</li><li>A lack of family and social support</li><li>Experimenting with drugs or alcohol</li><li>History of sexual or physical abuse</li><li>Being bullied</li><li>Increased risk-taking behavior</li><li>Involvement in child welfare system, juvenile justice system, homelessness or extreme povert</li></ul><p><strong>Warning signs of depression or possible suicide risk</strong><br>Identifying warning signs can be tricky because teenagers are moody. &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to distinguish between normal adolescent behavior and something more serious,&rdquo; said Winberry. She said to look for sudden shifts in behavior such as:</p><ul><li>A loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed</li><li>Sleeping a lot or not sleeping enough</li><li>Irritability</li><li>Negative mindset</li><li>Aggression</li><li>Social isolation</li><li>Being secretive</li></ul><p><strong>More extreme behaviors include:</strong></p><ul><li>Self-injury such as cutting</li><li>Feelings of hopelessness</li><li>Giving away possessions</li><li>Not having plans for the future</li><li>Preferring to be alone most of the time</li></ul><p>Many people think that asking someone about suicide thoughts will plant the seed to carry it out. But that&rsquo;s not the case, according to Winberry. &ldquo;If you suspect there&rsquo;s is an issue, talk to the child. Ask him if he&rsquo;s thinking about taking his life.&rdquo;</p><p>Recognizing and treating depression in young kids is crucial, before it becomes worse.</p><p>&ldquo;Early intervention is key,&rdquo; said Winberry. &ldquo;Ask how they are feeling in a non-judgmental way. Don&rsquo;t discredit their feelings. Just try to listen.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>What can parents do?</strong><br><strong>Encourage positive activities</strong>. There are some &ldquo;protective factors&rdquo; &ndash; activities that make youth depression less likely. These include team sports, having a mentor, spirituality, regular school attendance and a good support system of family and friends.</p><p><strong>Be alert</strong>. Know the warning signs and keep a close eye on a teen who is depressed and withdrawn.</p><p><strong>Keep the lines of communication open</strong>. Express concern, support and love. If your teen confides in you, show you take those concerns seriously. Don&rsquo;t minimize what your teen is going through&mdash;this may lead to a sense of hopelessness.</p><p><strong>Take emergency action when needed</strong>. If you think your child is contemplating suicide, get help immediately. Baptist Behavioral Health can refer you to a psychologist or child and adolescent psychiatrist. If it is crisis situation, take your child to the closest Emergency Department. If you aren&rsquo;t sure if you should take your child to ER, you can call 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433). There&rsquo;s also a number that young people can send text messages to 741-741. &nbsp;Texts are answered very quickly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Attend Youth Mental Health First Aid Training</strong>. Youth Mental Health First Aid, a free 8-hour training course teaches laypeople how to help an adolescent (age 12-18) who is experiencing a mental health or addiction challenge, or who is in crisis. The course introduces common mental health challenges for youth, reviews typical adolescent development, and teaches a five-step action plan on how to help young people in crisis and non-crisis situations. Topics covered include anxiety, depression, substance use, disorders in which psychosis may occur, disruptive behavior disorders (including ADHD), and eating disorders.</p><p><em>You can register for Youth Mental Health First Aid Training by clicking&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/d/fl--jacksonville/youth-mental-health-first-aid-(2-day)/\"><em>here.</em></a></p>",

Their unborn son was diagnosed with a cleft lip and a cleft palate condition.</p><p>Considered high risk because her first son, Kolton, now age 7, was born early at 33 weeks. Katelyn&rsquo;s obstetrician, Robert D. Mixson, MD, chief of the Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology at Southeast Georgia Health System-Camden Campus, referred her to a high-risk obstetrician. During a routine ultrasound just two-and-a-half weeks before Kaleb was born, doctors detected the baby&rsquo;s lip and mouth area had a visible difference.</p><p>&ldquo;We did not expect to get this news,&rdquo; Katelyn said. &ldquo;This condition does not run in our family.&rdquo;</p><p>The Williamsons were referred to the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/cleft-and-craniofacial-center\" target=\"_blank\">Snyder Family Cleft and Craniofacial Center at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>. The Center&rsquo;s interdisciplinary Cleft Palate Team provided the Williamsons with information about their son&rsquo;s condition, future treatment and care.</p><p>&ldquo;The Center&rsquo;s support team is amazing,&rdquo; Katelyn said. &ldquo;Before Kaleb was born, they helped us understand what to expect. When I delivered, Kaleb arrived at midnight and their support team arrived early the next morning, helping me learn how to feed him with a bottle designed for cleft babies.&rdquo;</p><p>Kaleb, now 2, has had three cleft lip and palate repair surgeries performed by the Cleft and Craniofacial Center&rsquo;s multidisciplinary team of specialists at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. The Williamsons are happy that Kaleb has been able to get exceptional quality medical and surgical care close to home at the Snyder Family Cleft and Craniofacial Center at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, which recently received approval from the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association (ACPA) as an ACPA-approved Cleft Palate Team and Craniofacial Team.</p><p>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital&rsquo;s regional program is one of 112 in the country, seven in Florida and two in Georgia to have earned this approval.</p><p>&ldquo;We are honored to have the Snyder Family Cleft and Craniofacial Center program receive ACPA approval, recognizing our team as having the highest level of training in cleft palate and craniofacial surgery,&rdquo; said pediatrician <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatrician/dr-jeffrey-goldhagen-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffrey Goldhagen, MD</a>, medical director of the Snyder Family Cleft and Craniofacial Center at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. &ldquo;The ACPA has established the standards for industry excellence and team recognition, and its approval recognizes our dedication to the highest quality of patient care.&rdquo;</p><p>To receive this national distinction, teams must meet the required standards of care and outcomes set by the ACPA, an international nonprofit association of more than 2,500 healthcare professionals who are involved in the treatment and research of cleft lip, cleft palate, and other craniofacial abnormalities.

Legendary rock icon, Mick Jagger reportedly underwent a heart valve replacement procedure earlier this week in New York.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/interventional-cardiologist/dr-ruby-satpathy-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby Satpathy</a>, MD, an interventional cardiologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/heart-vascular-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a> and medical director of the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/heart-vascular-care/structural-heart-program\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Structural Heart Program</a>, said Jagger could be rocking the stage in no time thanks to the relatively new procedure that will allow him to avoid open-heart surgery. You don&rsquo;t have to be a rock star to get rock-star treatment. Jagger&#39;s procedure, called a Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR), is available in Jacksonville.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Not long ago, open-heart surgery was the only solution for structural heart diseases,&rdquo; said Dr. Satpathy. &ldquo;And quite often, patients who needed these procedures were too high-risk to receive the care they needed. Now we can &lsquo;treat the untreatable&rsquo; using these minimally invasive procedures and our patients can start feeling better right away.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Love in &lsquo;vein&rsquo;</strong></p><p>The heart&rsquo;s structures include four chambers as well as valves that keep the blood flowing in the right direction, working together to keep blood traveling throughout the body.</p><p>While conditions affecting the structures of the heart are fairly common, more severe cases require care from structural heart experts like Dr. Satpathy. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The heart of a rock star</strong></p><p>During the TAVR procedure, a physician makes the small incision in the groin and guides the TAVR device into the heart valve to replace the failing valve.</p><p>TAVR is designed for people with severe aortic stenosis, one of the most common heart valve issues, who are high-risk candidates for open-heart surgery. Aortic stenosis restricts the blood flow from the left ventricle of the heart to the aorta. Symptoms of aortic stenosis may include chest pain, shortness of breath, heart palpitations and fatigue.</p><p><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1554489695/Juice/MDT-aortic-stenosis-infographic_FINAL.jpg.thumb.1280.1280.jpg\" alt=\"Aortic Stenosis\"></p><p><em>Image Source: Medtronic</em></p><p><strong>&lsquo;Time is on My Side&rsquo;</strong></p><p>Like the Rolling Stones 1964 hit single, time is on Jagger&rsquo;s side when it comes to recovery from his procedure.</p><p>For years, Dr. Satpathy has used a &ldquo;magic stitch,&rdquo; a catheter-based, minimally invasive technique that avoids any incision in the groin.</p><p>This approach enables the use of twilight sleep (also called conscious sedation) for surgery instead of general anesthesia, and allows patients to walk a few hours after surgery. Often, they can go home the day after the procedure.</p><p>&ldquo;With open-heart surgery, the chest is opened and the heart is temporarily stopped,&rdquo; explained Dr. Satpathy. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the case with the minimally invasive technique. We can do the procedure with a beating heart. That&rsquo;s a major benefit for our patients.&rdquo;</p><p>At-home recovery from open-heart surgery takes months but TAVR patients usually have a full recovery within a week.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&lsquo;Dancing in the street&rsquo;</strong></p><p>On April 5, 2019, reports were released confirming Jagger is now in recovery after a successful procedure. It sounds like he&rsquo;ll be back &ldquo;Dancing in the Street&rdquo; and on stage very soon.</p><p><em>To find out if you are a candidate for minimally invasive treatment options, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://baptiststructuralheart.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>baptiststructuralheart.com</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em><em>or call 904.202.9500.&nbsp;</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Raise your hand if you enjoy getting a mammogram. No?</p><p>Mammograms can mean an uncomfortable squish on a body part most of us would prefer to keep tucked privately inside our blouses. Still, you know it could save your life.</p><p>Annual mammograms lower a woman&rsquo;s chance of death from breast cancer by 30 to 40 percent, according to the American College of Radiology. Beginning at the age of 40, women should get a mammogram every year, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/radiologist/dr-trishna-patel-md\" target=\"_blank\">Trishna Patel, MD</a>, a radiologist at Baptist Health&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/hill-breast-center\" target=\"_blank\">Hill Breast Center</a>. They should start earlier if there&rsquo;s a family history of breast cancer.</p><p>So, what keeps us from getting our regular mammograms? Denial can be a powerful thing. Here are seven myths that could be standing between you and this all-important annual screening.</p><ol><li><strong>I&rsquo;ve always had 2D mammograms. There&rsquo;s no need for me to get a 3D mammogram.&nbsp;</strong>3D mammograms are more detailed and accurate than traditional mammograms, allowing physicians to examine breast tissue layer by layer. &ldquo;In traditional screening, any suspicious area on the image requires the patient to come back in for additional studies,&rdquo; said Dr. Patel. &ldquo;Studies show that 3D Mammography exams reduce the need to return for additional imaging by up to 30%. That increased accuracy not only helps expedite care, but also significantly reduces anxiety.&rdquo; Talk to your physician about what type of mammogram is right for you.</li><li><strong>I need a referral from my primary care physician.&nbsp;</strong>You do not need a referral from your primary care physician to get a mammogram. You can set up an appointment on your own.</li><li><strong>I don&#39;t have a family history of breast cancer, so I don&#39;t need a mammogram every year.&nbsp;</strong>Certainly having a family history is a significant risk factor for breast cancer&mdash;30 percent of breast cancers are found in women with a family member who&rsquo;s had the disease. But that leaves 70 percent of breast cancers found in women who have no family history. That means your risk is still high.</li><li><strong>Radiation from mammograms can cause cancer<span style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: initial;\">. &nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: initial;\">Actually, the radiation you get from a mammogram is a very low dose. About the same amount as you would get from the sun over a three-month period. Or, the same dosage that comes from taking a single cross-country airplane flight. &ldquo;No one ever talks about the risks to stewardesses or pilots of high-altitude radiation,&rdquo; Dr. Patel said. &ldquo;This has never been shown to cause other cancers.&rdquo;</span></li><li><strong>Mammograms hurt</strong>. To perform a mammogram, a machine flattens your breast slightly to ensure a clear image. There definitely is some discomfort, Dr. Patel said. But there are ways to minimize it. Schedule a mammogram for the middle part of your menstrual cycle, when your breasts are not as sensitive. Also, having a technologist who calmly talks you through the process can lower your blood pressure, heart rate and anxiety. &ldquo;We strive for a very spa-like atmosphere at the Hill Breast Center,&rdquo; Dr. Patel said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not here to smash you.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>If my lump doesn&rsquo;t hurt, it&rsquo;s not breast cancer</strong>. Breasts do produce masses that are benign, Dr. Patel said. But, until a doctor does a biopsy, there&rsquo;s no way to know for sure if a lump is harmless. Not all breast cancers hurt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my job to prove whether this is, or is not cancer,&rdquo; Dr. Patel said. &ldquo;A patient should never assume it&rsquo;s benign.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>I can tell whether I have dense breasts by ho</strong><strong>w they feel</strong>. When it comes to mammograms, your breast density matters. Dense tissue can hide cancer from X-rays, making your mammogram less reliable. High breast density also slightly raises your risk for breast cancer. Your breasts are dense if they have a higher amount of fibro-glandular and connective tissue. It&rsquo;s not something you can detect by the weight or feel of your breasts. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed new rules this year that say mammogram centers must tell women if they have dense breasts. The Hill Breast Center already does so. &ldquo;We tailor all of our screening to each individual.&rdquo; Dr. Patel said. &ldquo;For women with high breast density, we&rsquo;ll recommend 3D imaging instead of 2D imaging, and sometimes supplemental testing.&rdquo;</li></ol><p><em>Not all breast centers are equal.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/hill-breast-center\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Hill Breast Center</em></a><em>&nbsp;is recognized as a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence by the American College of Radiology and excels in patient satisfaction measures.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Just like our bodies, body shaming comes in all shapes and forms.</p><p>In the hit movie, &ldquo;A Star is Born,&rdquo; the main character, Ally, played by Lady Gaga, was told she couldn&rsquo;t make it as a singer because of the size of her nose. In her own life, Lady Gaga was given the same message and experienced other body shaming. After negative social media comments about her physique following a Super Bowl halftime performance in 2017, she inspired others by firing back, &ldquo;I&#39;m proud of my body and you should be proud of yours, too.&quot;</p><p>The Netflix film, &ldquo;Dumplin,&rdquo; tells the story of a plus-size teen who signs up for a pageant in protest of body shaming, even though her former beauty queen mother is the pageant coordinator. She proudly goes on stage with a friend wearing swimsuits with lettering that reads, &ldquo;Every body is a swimsuit body.&rdquo;</p><p>The Hulu comedy series, &ldquo;Shrill,&rdquo; starring Aidy Bryant of <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, also tackles body acceptance and being judged &ndash; even at work &ndash; because of your appearance.</p><p>These movies and shows are helping to break down stereotypes, especially in the age of social media where people routinely post before-and-after plastic surgery photos, along with makeovers.</p><p>Body shaming on social media has become an issue for youth and adults, both men and women. The pressure is real to be the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; size.</p><p>&ldquo;It is becoming more pervasive,&rdquo; said Mary Lou Prendergast, a licensed mental health counselor for Baptist Behavioral Health. &ldquo;We are drawn to the before-and-after photos and have high standards of what we are supposed to look like. The problem is that most of the time, we are very critical of ourselves and compare ourselves to others.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to accept the fact that people come in all different shapes and sizes,&rdquo; Prendergast added.</p><p><strong>Tips for accepting yourself and staying healthy</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Focus on the positive</strong>. Instead of focusing on your weight, focus on your strengths.</li><li><strong>Set realistic goals</strong>. Strive for smaller goals that you can reach that are right for you and your body.</li><li><strong>Find fun activities</strong>. Instead of walking or running on a treadmill, do something you enjoy, like walking outside in nature or doing Zumba where you are in a group atmosphere. &ldquo;Yoga is also a wonderful exercise and you are not comparing yourself to others. It&rsquo;s just you and your mat,&rdquo; Prendergast said.</li><li><strong>Unfollow people who make you feel inferior</strong>. Instead, follow a more diverse group of people with various shapes and sizes.</li><li><strong>Get rid of clothes in your closet that don&rsquo;t fit</strong>. Don&rsquo;t hold on to jeans you hope you can wear again someday. &ldquo;Seeing those clothes every morning generates negative thoughts about yourself,&rdquo; Prendergast said. &ldquo;Clean out your closet and only have clothes that fit you right now.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Buy clothes you like</strong>. They make you feel good.</li><li><strong>Eat healthier so you can feel healthier</strong>. When you eat healthy foods, your body will stop craving foods that are bad for you.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;My goal is to get people on the right path to eating real, whole foods and staying away from processed junk food,&rdquo; Prendergast said.</p><p>She added, &ldquo;Eating foods free of sugar, flour and wheat diminishes the cravings that set so many of us up to overeat and binge. Fewer cravings for junk food help us both physically and psychologically. When you start eating healthier, you&rsquo;ll also see your blood sugar and cholesterol go down.&rdquo;</p><p><em>At Baptist Health, your mental and emotional health are vital components of your overall health.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Talking to your physician about sensitive health issues can be a little uncomfortable. Whether it&rsquo;s a sexual problem, hidden rash, body odor or an emotional issue, don&rsquo;t let embarrassment keep you from getting the care you need.</p><p>I always appreciate when a patient trusts me enough to ask personal questions. Here are a few I get:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why do I sweat so much?</strong><br>Sweating is normal &ndash; it cools your body down when you need it. Make sure you&rsquo;re using a combination antiperspirant/deodorant. Deodorant masks odors, and an antiperspirant blocks sweat glands, which decreases sweat. You need both.</p><p>If that doesn&rsquo;t help, talk to your doctor about other alternatives, like a prescription antiperspirant or other treatments. For example, Botox &ndash; the same treatment that smooths wrinkles -- can also block armpit nerves that stimulate sweat glands.</p><p>Heavy sweating can be caused by hormonal changes, medications (some antibiotics, antidepressants and pain relievers), but could also be a sign of more serious medical condition like diabetes, thyroid issues or an infection.</p><p>Of course, it&rsquo;s normal to sweat when exercising, in the heat or when you are nervous. But if you&rsquo;re sweating more than usual or have other symptoms, talk to your doctor.</p><p><strong>Why do I have such bad breath?</strong><br>Halitosis, or bad breath, can be embarrassing, but most people have it at some point.</p><p>Most often, it&rsquo;s related to oral hygiene or dental issues. Particles from food can remain in your teeth and collect bacteria. Plaque buildup and cavities can also lead to bad breath. So make sure you&rsquo;re brushing, flossing and scrubbing your tongue daily. Also drink plenty of water and see your dentist regularly.</p><p>Rarely, bad breath can be caused by other medical conditions. Some examples include xerostomia (a condition known as dry mouth), diabetes, reflux, an upper respiratory infection, sinus issues, and even kidney/liver disease. Smoking or using tobacco products can also cause bad breath.</p><p>Mouthwash, mints and gum may help with bad breath, but only temporarily. If you&rsquo;re constantly trying to mask bad breath, you should see your dentist or doctor.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why are my feet stinky?</strong><br>Increased moisture and warmth cause feet to sweat, which creates an environment where bacteria can grow. Fungal infections, like athlete&#39;s foot, can also lead to bad foot odor.</p><p>One way to prevent this is to wear good-quality shoes with breathable features, such as leather or mesh, along with wearing socks with moisture-wicking features. Another idea is to use insoles with odor-preventing or antibacterial features. If that doesn&rsquo;t help, try putting antibacterial or anti-fungal powder in your shoes.</p><p><strong>Why am I constipated?</strong><br>Constipation is defined as three or fewer bowel movements a week. Occasional constipation is normal, but chronic constipation can cause abdominal pain, bloating, cramps, decreased appetite and fatigue. &nbsp;</p><p>Rarely, a more serious medical condition or medications can be the cause. Chronic constipation can be the result of a blockage in the colon or rectum. A blockage can slow or stop stool movement (such as bowel obstruction or cancer). Neurological problems (such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson&rsquo;s disease) and abnormal hormones (such as those caused by thyroid issues, pregnancy or diabetes) can also be to blame.</p><p>Some ways to avoid constipation include:</p><ul><li>Drink plenty of water daily</li><li>Eat high-fiber fruits, vegetables and whole grains with every meal</li><li>Avoid being sedentary</li><li>Exercise regularly and manage stress<br><br></li></ul><p>If you&rsquo;re still suffering from constipation, see your doctor.<br><br><strong>How much sex is normal?</strong><br>It&rsquo;s normal to wonder if you&rsquo;re having more or less sex than others. There is no &ldquo;normal&rdquo; amount of sex. There are many factors that influence frequency such as health, job stress, age, and relationship status.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1554745285/Juice/jami-feltner-md-t.jpg\" alt=\"Feltner\"></div><p>Couples in the first few years of a relationship typically have sex more often. This can decrease after children or with other life changes. The &ldquo;normal&rdquo; amount of sex can be different for each person.</p><p>The key is finding the frequency that is right for both of you. Every couple is different and communication is the key.</p><p><em>Our guest columnist is <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/internist/dr-jami-feltner-md\">Jami Feltner, MD,</a> an internist with Baptist Primary Care.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Marriage, divorce, new baby, a death in the family, moving, losing a job, starting a new job, holiday season and taxes.</p><p>What do these situations all have in common?</p><p>They&rsquo;re all social stressors. &ldquo;We all face these in life when there is any high activity event that puts a demand on our time and resources,&rdquo; said Anna Maria Genotti, a board-certified psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>.</p><p>Stressing over finances, in particular, can wreak havoc on our health. A survey released last year by the American Psychiatric Association showed finances are playing an increased role in people&rsquo;s anxiety.</p><p>But there are simple steps you can take to handle life&rsquo;s unexpected changes or even planned events like tax season or relocating to a new city.</p><p><strong>1. Take a deep breath. Recognize the situation for what it is.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;People get so caught up in the cycle of projecting concerns about the stressful event that they then forecast ahead and start catastrophizing (believing something is far worse than it is),&rdquo; Genotti said. &ldquo;Your mind starts spinning and projecting all the worst-case scenarios, and you don&rsquo;t see the actual situation and possible solutions.&rdquo;</p><p>For example, if you lose your job, the reality is you&#39;ve likely had other jobs in the past. Therefore, the possibility exists even in your personal history that you&#39;ll have another job again.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It will take time and effort, but you have to be an active participant in your solution,&rdquo; said Genotti.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Set a goal with a timeline.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Set your own deadline a little before an actual deadline that stresses you out, like tax season. Make sure you have that breathing space so you know you have met your goal and achieved it before the deadline,&rdquo; Genotti said.</p><p><strong>3. Evaluate if you need help.</strong></p><p>If you are not going to achieve this goal on your own, do you need help? Do you need someone to help you with budgeting, for example? &nbsp;Is it going to take more effort or knowledge than what you know how to do? If you are struggling, in general, to pay your bills, is there other funding, financial counseling or support available.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Resources exist for various support needs, but you need to recognize you need the help and ask,&rdquo; Genotti added.</p><p><strong>4. Prepare for next year.</strong></p><p>Get through your current situation and prepare for next year. &ldquo;Use this as a perfect motivation so you don&rsquo;t end up in the same situation next year,&rdquo; Genotti said. &nbsp;For your taxes or a financial situation you may be facing, ensure you are prepared. &nbsp;Start a folder and keep receipts for next year, evaluate your payroll deductions, build up your savings. Set phone calendar reminders to keep you on track all year long.</p><p><strong>5. Set a reward goal.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Recognize what you have achieved and set a measurable goal for next year. If you owed taxes this year, set a goal not to owe or to owe less next year. If you want to buy a new car, go to New York City or take a cruise, these can be motivators to get your finances in proper order.</p><p>&ldquo;You can spin stressful events into positive situations instead of being unprepared and getting caught into a cycle of only seeing the negative aspects,&rdquo; Genotti said.</p><p><strong>6. Take another deep breath.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Stress is all about how you perceive a situation,&rdquo; Genotti said. &ldquo;Change is uncomfortable and change is scary. But if you recognize that the same situation and same solution aren&rsquo;t resulting in the desired goal you want to achieve, you might have to be a more active participant in order to bring about that positive change and to meet your goal.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you&rsquo;re having problems coping with life stresses, Baptist Behavioral Health specialists can provide personalized care that fits your needs.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Nine months sounds like a long time, but it can be a whirlwind for pregnant women preparing for the day when their baby boy or girl arrives. In the days that follow, new mothers will learn how to change diapers and function on minimal sleep, but they might not anticipate having difficulty breastfeeding.<br><br>&ldquo;A lot of moms think it will be just very natural for them, that breasts were made for breastfeeding and they do think that babies will just know what to do,&rdquo; said Kathleen Hugo, RN, IBCLC, Women&rsquo;s Resource Community coordinator for Baptist Health.<br><br>The reality is, Hugo said, many women will struggle.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new dance you&rsquo;re learning, your baby is your new dance partner, and you&rsquo;ve got to figure out your moves together,&rdquo; Hugo said.<br><br>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants be exclusively breastfed for their first six months, but a woman&rsquo;s inability or difficulty doing so can lead to disappointment or even contribute to postpartum depression.<br><br>&ldquo;They feel defeated,&rdquo; said Johannah Seifert, RN, IBCLC. &ldquo;They feel like they&rsquo;re doing something wrong or they&rsquo;re not providing what they need for their baby. So it really takes a toll on them.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;When a mother is six to eight weeks &nbsp;postpartum, her OB will assess her emotional state and even administer the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale survey [a postpartum depression screening tool],&rdquo; said Hugo. &ldquo;In about 40 percent of the mothers who test positively, a common denominator is that they have been struggling with breastfeeding,&rdquo; Hugo said.<br><br>Both Hugo and Seifert identified two key strategies for helping women succeed at breastfeeding.</p><p>First, women need to manage expectations and understand the process may not come naturally. Hugo said women should maximize skin-to-skin contact with their baby and spend time learning cues that the baby wants to feed, and understand how to be successful.<br><br>Second, women should begin preparation before the baby is born. That includes speaking with their OB or their baby&rsquo;s pediatrician and attending breastfeeding classes.<br><br>&ldquo;A lot of people have never seen breastfeeding, don&rsquo;t know what it looks like, and then try to do it,&rdquo; Seifert said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Our classes, which are available to all women in the community, help them feel more comfortable with breastfeeding.&rdquo;<br><br>Overall, Hugo said women should remember that in order to take care of their babies, they have to take care of themselves.<br><br><em>A support system is vital for women who are having difficulty breastfeeding.

The debate has long raged, and men come down on either side of it for reasons of style, comfort, sexiness, and even fertility.</p><p>But do boxers really win over briefs when it comes to fertility? There&rsquo;s medical research that suggests they do.</p><p>A study published last summer in the journal <em>Human Reproduction</em> found men who wore boxers instead of briefs had a higher sperm count and lower FSH levels. FSH is a hormone that kicks in to produce more sperm. It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s needed in higher doses when sperm is being damaged by say, semen-hostile underwear.</p><p>Wearing boxers to improve your chances of conceiving may sound like superstition. But <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/hospitalist-family-medicine/dr-jonathan-gonzalez-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Gonzalez, MD</a>, a family doctor with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a>, said it&rsquo;s an idea that&rsquo;s been around for a while.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;There were a couple of studies a long time ago where researchers thought tight briefs created infertility issues because they elevated the testicles and changed their temperature one or two degrees,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>The theory being, testicles warm up when held tight to the body. When allowed a little more space, they cool. That could matter because a too-high temperature can hurt sperm.</p><p>But there are lots of things that can elevate temperature or damage sperm.</p><p>Marijuana, drugs and alcohol are all causes Dr. Gonzalez has talked with patients about. Tighty whities? Not so much.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never sat with a couple where somebody out there had told them the tightness of their underwear caused infertility,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of far fetched.&rdquo;</p><p>So, when it comes to male infertility, what kinds of things do doctors look at?</p><p>Diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol are all considered because these conditions affect the blood flow. They&rsquo;re more common later in life, but with today&rsquo;s obesity epidemic, they sometimes appear in patients during their reproductive years.</p><p>Anabolic steroids are another big culprit.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes guys in college do steroids for a year or two, and it gets them behind when they try to have a kid later on in life,&rdquo; Dr. Gonzalez said. &ldquo;It drops their testosterone, and so they don&rsquo;t produce as much sperm.&rdquo;</p><p>Though he doubts tight underwear is at the root of infertility, for couples who are trying for a baby, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to think about it, Dr. Gonzalez said.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to optimize everything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like&mdash;when you put a cake in the oven, you want the perfect temperature. You want the perfect non-stick pan. You want everything to be perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>So, if you&rsquo;re trying to have a baby, go for it. Do anything that could help. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s not hard to simply buy another pair of underwear.</p><p><em>For more answers about fertility, contact your Baptist Health primary care physician, who may refer you to a specialist if needed.

I practically lived on the road, covering game after game,&rdquo; recalled Hale last August in an interview with <em>Women&rsquo;s Health</em> magazine. &ldquo;I had worked hard to get to where I was, and I wasn&rsquo;t prepared to let these strange symptoms slow me down.&rdquo;</p><p>But after her feet started to swell, and when the swelling extended to her legs and waist, Hale went to the nearest emergency room (ER) to get checked out.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad I did. An ER doctor said it was likely caused by cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;An echocardiogram revealed that my heart was only pumping at 16 percent capacity. That explained my exhaustion and the swelling in my lower body.&rdquo;</p><p>To be precise, Hale, now 40, was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, where the left ventricle of the heart becomes enlarged or dilated and can&rsquo;t effectively pump blood out of the heart.</p><p>The condition can affect people of all ages but occurs most often in middle-aged men.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1554127471/Juice/pamela-rama-md-8x10_March2014.jpg\" alt=\"Rama\"></div><p>&ldquo;There are numerous causes of dilated cardiomyopathy, but one that is often overlooked is familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDC),&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-pamela-rama-md\" target=\"_blank\">Pamela Rama</a>, MD, a cardiologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s estimated that between 20 and 35 percent of patients diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy have FDC. It&rsquo;s very important to tell your doctor if you have family members who have been diagnosed with unexplained heart failure or sudden death.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Thrown a LifeVest</strong></p><p>Hale&rsquo;s father, a former federal agent, and her grandfather suffered fatal heart attacks before the age of 50.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Cardiomyopathy had never affected the women in my family, only the men,&rdquo; recalled Hale. &ldquo;I had always worried about my brother&rsquo;s heart health, but I never thought twice about my own.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Dr. Rama, chief of staff and medical director of Cardio-Pulmonary Rehabilitation at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-beaches\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Beaches</a>, women tend to think heart disease won&rsquo;t happen to them, so they often ignore their symptoms. &ldquo;Most of the time, they seek medical attention later when the condition is far more advanced,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>After being diagnosed, Hale was referred to a cardiologist in New Orleans who specializes in advanced heart failure and transplant cardiology. He put her on a medication to reduce the size of her enlarged heart. &ldquo;They called it heart remodeling. It&rsquo;s about a two-year process before you know if it&rsquo;s going to work or not,&rdquo; Hale recounted on an Oct. 8, 2018, episode of <em>The Megyn Kelly Show</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>As a precaution, Hale was also placed on a heart transplant list. Her cardiologist also suggested she cut back on her hectic work schedule.</p><p>&ldquo;I agreed to cut back, but my job is my passion,&rdquo; said Hale, a former Emmy Award-winning TV anchor in New Orleans who joined the NFL on FOX in 2011. &ldquo;I knew taking time off would not only slow my career, but it would also be detrimental to my mental health. I was honest about that with my doctor, and he agreed to help me.&rdquo;</p><p>In addition to taking heart medication, Hale was issued a personal defibrillator known as a LifeVest&reg; that continuously monitored her heart&rsquo;s activity. The device was also engineered to deliver a shock to her heart if it stopped pumping.</p><p><strong>Off the transplant list</strong></p><p>During the eight months Hale wore the vest under her clothes, her heart never needed to be shocked. &ldquo;It was the perfect way for me to continue living while my heart was healing,&rdquo; she added.</p><p>Hale&rsquo;s heart medication has worked so well that she was taken off the heart transplant list in February 2018. In October 2018, her heart was functioning at 51 percent. &ldquo;Your heart never functions at 100 percent. Normal, I have been told, is anywhere between 60 and 70 percent,&rdquo; Hale recounted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at the low end of normal and we hope my heart is still shrinking.&rdquo;</p><p>This past fall, Hale marked her eighth season as a sideline reporter for the NFL and her seventh with the NBA. In her spare time, she enjoys cycling and CrossFit&reg;.</p><p>&ldquo;Cardiomyopathy will always be a big part of my life,&rdquo; said Hale, a women&rsquo;s health spokesperson. &ldquo;I urge people to know their family heart history and get checked out.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Every year, approximately 400,000 women in the U.S. get breast implants, including 100,000 who undergo reconstruction after mastectomy to treat or prevent breast cancer. Breast reconstruction has been used for years to help women reclaim their bodies after mastectomy.</p><p>News broke in mid-March that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was investigating the safety of breast implants after reports they may cause breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). BIA-ALCL is a type of non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma which affects an unknown number of women, with published rates ranging from one in 3,800 to one in 30,000.</p><p>Currently, the FDA is aware of 457 confirmed cases of BIA-ALCL out of the estimated 10 million women worldwide who have implants. Because rates are low and implants have the potential to help women&rsquo;s quality of life after breast cancer treatment, how should doctors balance the benefits and risks?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/plastic-surgeon/dr-ankit-desai-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ankit Desai, MD</a>, is a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center </a>whose primary area of focus is reconstructive surgery for breast cancer patients. As new research tries to find what puts some women at risk of BIA-ALCL, he said it&rsquo;s important for surgeons to inform their patients of all possible risks and benefits of implants.</p><p>&ldquo;BIA-ALCL is a real disease that happens. The actual incidence is probably less than being hit by lightning. It&rsquo;s rare and related to the use of textured implants but we&rsquo;re just starting to understand it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some patients may benefit from the use of textured implants most commonly used in conjunction with shaped/gummy bear implants. I would discuss the benefits and risks with the patients so they can make an informed decision about what they feel is best for their particular needs. But it has to be part of their decision.&rdquo;</p><p>Textured implants were used in nearly all cases of BIA-ALCL. Implants with textured surfaces are sometimes used for patients who have had implants before that wouldn&rsquo;t stay in place.</p><p>&ldquo;Roughness means there are more areas for bacteria to hide. The theory is that BIA-ALCL is caused by a prolonged inflammatory reaction that can flip a switch and develop a lymphoma. There&rsquo;s a bacterium that has possibly been linked to creating that inflammation response, which seems most commonly related to patients who have had a textured implant,&rdquo; said Dr. Desai.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we have enough information on it yet, but I do think that patients need to be advised of the relationship to this lymphoma,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/general-surgeon/dr-beth-lesnikoski-md\" target=\"_blank\">Beth-Ann Lesnikoski, MD</a>, a breast surgical oncologist and director of the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center/breast-cancer\" target=\"_blank\">Breast Program at Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>. &ldquo;It needs to be part of their decision-making process. Women are very capable of making informed choices, and individuals deal with risk numbers very, very differently.&rdquo;</p><p>Most cases of BIA-ALCL began eight to 10 years after implant surgery, and were usually detected because of a common symptom.</p><p>&ldquo;The main thing we look for is delayed onset fluid collection around implants which have otherwise been stable,&rdquo; said Dr. Lesnikoski.</p><p>Both experts say the rare condition is highly treatable and hope research will soon answer key questions so they can better serve their patients.</p><p>&ldquo;A better perspective of additional risk factors would be very important,&rdquo; said Dr. Lesnikoski. &ldquo;For instance, with melanoma, we take into account complexion. What other risk factors exist besides having implants? Family history of autoimmune diseases could be important.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ideally we could identify a true incidence of BIA-ALCL and find out the exact cause, maybe it can be prevented said Dr. Desai. &ldquo;I want to have an in-depth, informed consent conversation with my patients about the benefits and risks.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Desai feels women who are interested in breast implants or reconstruction should feel comfortable asking their doctor any questions they may have.</p><p>&ldquo;The breast implant is the most studied medical device in the world, and data suggest it&rsquo;s reasonably safe with high patient satisfaction,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Women with breast implants should receive annual screening mammograms (or more often if their doctor recommends) and reach out to their primary care doctor if they have questions about their health.

A routine ride unexpectedly changed with a crash.</p><p>&ldquo;We went to ride for a few hours and something went horribly wrong on a jump,&rdquo; said Shawnda McDaniel, Nickolas&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;At first, Nickolas didn&rsquo;t appear to be hurt. But moments after the accident, things quickly changed.&rdquo;</p><p>While his external injuries looked minimal, Nickolas&rsquo;s internal injuries were severe and he began experiencing shortness of breath. Shawnda and Frankie, Nickolas&rsquo;s father, took their son immediately to the ER at a local hospital for an examination. There, the medical team ordered a CAT scan and X-rays and determined Nickolas had severely lacerated his liver from the blunt force of the crash.</p><p>On the medical Liver Injury Scale Classification, Nickolas had a grade IV injury, with I being the least severe and IV being the most severe. Nickolas also suffered a bruised lung and kidney laceration from the fall.</p><p>&ldquo;I was so scared,&rdquo; said Shawnda. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what was going to happen to my son.&rdquo;</p><p>The medical team recommended Nickolas be transferred to the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/emergency\" target=\"_blank\">Pediatric Trauma Center</a> at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Jacksonville.

Nickolas spent three days in the Pediatric ICU at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, where he underwent additional testing and monitoring for internal bleeding. Nickolas&rsquo;s discharge orders included limited activity for nearly two months, providing time for the liver to heal.</p><p>&ldquo;We wanted to make sure that Nickolas&rsquo;s liver and internal organs were stable,&rdquo; said Dr. Poulos. &ldquo;When a liver sustains damage, time will make it more solid.&rdquo;</p><p>Nickolas, who is a fifth grader at Williams Heights Elementary School in Waycross, spent seven weeks recovering at home before Dr. Poulos cleared him to return to school and resume all physical activities without restrictions. Nickolas will return to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s for occasional check-ups.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone we met at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s &ndash; the trauma team, the nurses and the housekeeping staff &ndash; were amazing,&rdquo; said Shawnda.</p><p>Dr. Poulos encourages everyone to use proper safety precautions and think twice before engaging in high-risk activities.</p><p>&ldquo;Although Nickolas was wearing a helmet and proper safety gear, he was undertaking a sport with an inherent risk that can lead to an accident and serious injury,&rdquo; said Dr. Poulos.</p><p>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital has the most experienced pediatric emergency teams, offering comprehensive, high-level for children with life-threatening and urgent medical needs.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>New research has shown that taking a daily aspirin &ndash; long a standard practice &ndash; won&#39;t necessarily keep a heart attack away for generally healthy adults who have low to moderate risk for a heart attack or stroke.</p><p>And in older adults with no cardiovascular risk factors, aspirin could actually cause more harm than good.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re shying away from giving everyone, including senior adults, a daily low-dose aspirin, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-carlos-zamora-md\" target=\"_blank\">Carlos R. Zamora, MD</a>, a cardiologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/heart-vascular-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a>. &ldquo;We are now taking a more individualized approach in deciding who really needs it.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite being a common practice for decades, prescribing a daily dose of so-called &ldquo;baby aspirin&rdquo; is no longer recommended by the American Heart Association or the American College of Cardiology. The two organizations recently released new low-dose aspirin guidelines after clinical trials showed the benefits don&rsquo;t always outweigh the risks, which include an increase in internal bleeding, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>But Dr. Zamora and the American Heart Association emphasize that the new recommendations are not for people who already have had a stroke or heart attack, or have undergone bypass surgery or other stent procedures. &ldquo;These patients with established heart disease can still have a positive benefit,&rdquo; said Dr. Zamora.</p><p><strong>New guidelines and expert recommendations</strong></p><p>A daily low-dose 75 to 100 mg aspirin is not recommended for adults older than 70 for the primary prevention of coronary artery disease, heart attack or stroke if they have no known cardiovascular risk. Aspirin is potentially harmful given the higher risk of bleeding in this age group.</p><p>Adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding should not be given a low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary artery disease.</p><p>People who have had a stroke, heart attack, cardiovascular disease or peripheral vascular disease (a blood circulation disorder) should continue taking a low-dose aspirin as recommended by their health care provider. Aspirin is known to have antithrombotic effects in reducing the formation of blood clots or blockages in blood vessels.</p><p>If you have been taking a daily aspirin and you do not have heart disease, consult with your primary care doctor about whether you should stop.</p><p>The new guidelines come after an extensive review. Several significant studies published last year, and a major analysis released this year, showed that the benefit of taking a daily low-dose aspirin was offset by the danger of internal bleeding and other side effects for people considered to be at low or moderate risk for heart disease.</p><p>Those who are not at high risk can protect themselves from a stroke or heart attack, experts say, through healthy eating habits, exercise and avoiding tobacco.</p><p>&ldquo;Good lifestyle habits provide much better benefits in preventing cardiovascular disease with no side effects and can be incorporated into your day-to-day life,&rdquo; Dr. Zamora said.</p><p>Engaging in regular brisk physical activity and adhering to a healthy diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains is key. Fish, legumes and poultry are the preferred sources of protein. Minimizing the consumption of trans fats, added sugars (including sugar-sweetened beverages), red meats, sodium and saturated fats is also essential.</p><p><em>If you are concerned about your heart health, visit <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">baptistjax.com/heart</a> to find a cardiologist near you.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Brooke Shields, Drew Barrymore and Gwyneth Paltrow have all spoken out about having postpartum depression. But many new moms keep their feelings to themselves.</p><p>&ldquo;Postpartum depression is very common,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/obstetrician-and-gynecologist/dr-blake-butterworth-md\" target=\"_blank\">Blake Butterworth, MD</a>, an OB/GYN with Women&#39;s Care Florida who delivers at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-south\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center South</a>. &ldquo;But many women don&rsquo;t tell anyone how they feel.&rdquo; Some worry it&rsquo;s a reflection of their motherhood skills or that they&rsquo;ll be labeled &ldquo;bad moms.&rdquo;</p><p>About 10% to 20% of all new moms suffer from severe depression after giving birth. It usually happens about two weeks after having a baby, but can happen as late as six to 12 months after the baby is born.</p><p>Some moms mistake their depression for the exhaustion that comes with caring for a newborn around the clock.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy to tell the difference between the normal fatigue and stress that can accompany parenthood and postpartum depression. Most new parents feel overwhelmed and tired, and that&rsquo;s normal,&rdquo; said Dr. Butterworth. He says that when the feelings interfere with your ability to perform daily functions, especially caring for the baby, it&rsquo;s time to get help.</p><p>Whiles there&rsquo;s no definitive test to determine if it&rsquo;s postpartum depression, here&rsquo;s what to look for:</p><ul><li>Feeling worthless and hopeless</li><li>Diminished interest in activities you normally like</li><li>Extreme feelings of guilt for no reason</li><li>Decreased appetite</li><li>Extreme fatigue</li><li>Lack of concentration</li></ul><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for your partner and other family members to be aware of these symptoms,&rdquo; said Dr. Butterworth. &ldquo;They may notice that you aren&rsquo;t yourself before you do and can help intervene so things don&rsquo;t get worse.&rdquo;</p><p>Anybody can get postpartum depression, but women who are prone to depression have an increased risk, as do those with a family history of depression. If it&rsquo;s not treated, the condition may last months or longer. Treatment usually involves counseling, antidepressants or hormone therapy, or a combination.</p><p>Even for breastfeeding moms, antidepressants are sometimes prescribed. Your doctor will assess the potential risks and benefits of taking medication to help you make the decision that&rsquo;s right for you.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to note that treatment is not just about medication; therapy can play a larger role. Talking about your feelings helps tremendously,&rdquo; Dr. Butterworth said.</p><p>Many people assume that postpartum depression is caused by hormonal changes, but there is no conclusive evidence to support that theory. &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly after delivery, which could contribute to depression, but that hasn&rsquo;t been proven,&rdquo; Dr. Butterworth said.</p><p>New dads can experience postpartum depression as well. Called paternal postpartum depression, the symptoms are the same. Those at highest risk are young fathers with a history of depression; relationship and financial problems can also contribute. The treatment for fathers is the same as it is for mothers experiencing the condition.</p><p>For anyone experiencing depression after childbirth, Dr. Butterworth stresses that it&rsquo;s important &ldquo;not to beat yourself up&rdquo; if you experience sadness.</p><p>&ldquo;Postpartum depression isn&rsquo;t a character flaw. It&rsquo;s a medical condition, just like having diabetes or high blood pressure, and it needs to be treated.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Pregnancy is hard, and we know parents-to-be have a lot of important questions.

It was a lot to take in,&rdquo; said Daniel-Smith.</p><p>Three weeks later, the 53-year-old Jacksonville resident underwent laparoscopic surgery at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a> to remove a portion of her colon and 20 of her lymph nodes.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Morgental\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/c_scale,w_1104/v1552936513/Juice/craig-morgenthal-md-8x10.jpg\"></div><p>&ldquo;A mass this large is often associated with invasive cancer but fortunately, we caught this early,&rdquo; said Daniel-Smith&rsquo;s gastrointestinal surgeon <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/general-surgeon/dr-craig-morgenthal-md \" target=\"_blank \">Craig Morgenthal, MD</a>, vice chair of the Department of Surgery at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville and a faculty member of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center \" target=\"_blank \">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>. &ldquo;Her final pathology report showed that surgery was curative. There was no invasive cancer and no need for chemotherapy.&rdquo;</p><p>Hours after her minimally invasive surgery, Daniel-Smith was sitting in a chair in her hospital room talking with family members. She was eating, drinking and walking the next day in the hospital.</p><p>Daniel-Smith&rsquo;s speedy recovery was due in part to an innovative new set of protocols at Baptist Health known as <a href=\"http://Baptistjax.com/ERAS\" target=\"_blank\">Enhanced Recovery After Surgery&nbsp;</a>(ERAS), which emphasizes nutrition, fluids and activity. It also minimizes practices that can place stress on the body during and after surgery.</p><p><strong>4 key components of&nbsp;</strong><strong>ERAS</strong><strong>&nbsp;at&nbsp;</strong><strong>Baptist Health</strong></p><ol start=\"1\" type=\"1 \"><li><strong>Starting to prepare the body as soon as surgery is scheduled</strong>. Patients are encouraged to start preparing by getting regular exercise (walking at least 15 minutes a day) and eating a well-balanced diet with a recommendation of at least 60 grams of protein a day. Those who smoke, vape or chew tobacco are strongly encouraged to quit because the practice could slow down their ability to heal.</li><li><strong>Encouraging clear liquids and &ldquo;carb-loading&rdquo; before surgery</strong>. Instead of fasting after midnight, new research shows that patients do better when they are allowed to have clear liquids up to two hours before scheduled arrival time for surgery. Some patients are also given a clear pre-surgery carbohydrate drink to help them maintain good blood glucose levels during surgery. This is similar to how runners use &ldquo;carb-loading&rdquo; to prepare for a race.</li><li><strong>Comfortably managing pain with limited use of opioids</strong>. Targeted pain management and careful management of IV fluids during and after surgery reduce the use of narcotic painkillers and help patients avoid side effects such as nausea, dizziness and constipation&mdash;all of which can stress the body.</li><li><strong>Stimulating recovery with activity and nutrition</strong>. Instead of emphasizing bed rest, patients are encouraged to drink, eat and move as soon as possible. ERAS patients are encouraged to sit in a chair more than in their beds, and walk to stimulate healing and digestion.</li></ol><p>Baptist Health has implemented ERAS in four surgical specialties so far &ndash; colon, urology, thoracic and gynecologic oncology&mdash; with plans to spread it to more specialties, including orthopedics, in the near future. International studies have consistently shown that ERAS protocols provide many benefits, including notably shorter hospital stays and reduced treatment complications.</p><p>&ldquo;All surgeons want the best outcomes for their patients and ERAS can help accomplish that,&rdquo; Dr. Morgenthal said. &ldquo;Patients can significantly improve their recovery time and have a better overall experience with ERAS.&rdquo;</p><p>Since her surgery, Daniel-Smith has lost weight and is exercising more. She plans to participate in the upcoming March to Get Screened 5K walk/run in Riverside, which raises awareness for colon cancer.</p><p>Last fall, she and her husband said their wedding vows for a second time and celebrated their reunion with a honeymoon cruise to the Bahamas.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get to walk down the aisle on the ship like I planned, but I was still able to go on the cruise,&rdquo; said Daniel-Smith. &ldquo;Before we separated seven years ago, my husband and I were married for 25 years. I feel like God put us back together just in the nick of time.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size4of4\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"CoupleonCruise\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1552936517/Juice/Betty_and_Richard_on_honeymoon_cruise.jpg\"></div><p><em>If you are interested in learning more about faster recovery after surgery, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/enhanced-recovery\" target=\"_blank\"><em>baptistjax.com/ERAS</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Antibiotics have been used for decades to treat infections. But not every antibiotic is created equal, especially when it comes to your heart health. And, if you already have a heart condition, you may be even more susceptible than others.</p><p>In a recent review, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that fluoroquinolone antibiotics &ndash; prescribed for more than 30 years for certain bacterial infections &ndash; could increase the occurrence of rare, but serious events of ruptures or tears in the aorta, the main artery of the body. These aortic aneurysm tears can lead to dangerous bleeding or even death, the FDA reported.</p><p>Fluoroquinolone antibiotics include Cipro (ciprofloxacin), Levaquin (levofloxacin), Factive, (gemifloxacin) and Avelox (moxifloxacin). These medications are often prescribed to treat upper respiratory or urinary tract infections.</p><p>&ldquo;Antibiotics are life-saving medications in many instances. They can cure the body of infections that can often lead to serious complications or death,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-salil-patel-md\" target=\"_blank\">Salil Patel, MD</a>, a cardiologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a>. &ldquo;But given the fact that all medications can have side effects, you should have a discussion with your physician about whether antibiotics are truly necessary for your particular condition. People at increased risk from cardiac events with antibiotics typically have pre-existing heart conditions.&rdquo;</p><p>Because multiple studies showed higher rates of about twice the risk of aortic aneurysm rupture and tears in those taking these medications, the FDA is requiring that a new warning about the risk be added to the prescribing information and patient medication guide.</p><p><strong>Who&rsquo;s at higher risk?</strong></p><p>People with a history of blockages or aneurysms (abnormal bulges) of the aorta or other blood vessels, high blood pressure, certain genetic disorders that involve blood vessel changes such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and the elderly are most at risk.</p><p>Dr. Patel said most antibiotics don&rsquo;t cause physical damage to the heart, but some antibiotics can cause chemical and physiologic changes in the body that can impact heart function and cause rhythm abnormalities.</p><p>Macrolide antibiotics, azithromycin, and clarithromycin, for example, have been associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular death, Dr. Patel said, even several years after taking the medication in some patients with existing heart conditions.</p><p>&ldquo;They are known to potentially cause irregular heart rhythms in some patients with preexisting heart disease,&rdquo; Dr. Patel said.</p><p>When considering antibiotics, ask your doctor these questions:</p><ul><li><strong>Are antibiotics truly necessary?</strong> Not all common conditions, such as many upper respiratory infections, require antibiotics, Dr. Patel said. See if there are other conservative measures. Ear infections in adults, for example, are often caused by viruses, and antibiotics are not recommended as initial treatment. Sometimes ear drops or anti-inflammatory medications can do the trick.</li><li><strong>Can it interact with other medications?</strong> Ask if the specific antibiotic you are prescribed could interact with other medications you may be taking.</li><li><strong>What are the warnings and side effects?</strong> Be aware of the warnings for any antibiotic you may be considering, particularly as it relates to your specific medical conditions.</li></ul><p><em>If you are or were taking antibiotics for an extended period of time, sometimes routine lab work or diagnostic studies such as an electrocardiogram (EKG) can be done to assess whether you may be at increased risk of complications.

By 2040 as the population grows and ages, the percentage of adults with doctor-diagnosed arthritis is projected to be 26 percent, or 78 million, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Arthritis occurs more often as we age and is more common in women than men. Genetics can also play a role. The most common is osteoarthritis or &ldquo;wear&ndash;and-tear arthritis&rdquo; where the cartilage that provides cushion between the bones or joints, similar to shock absorbers, deteriorates, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/orthopedic-surgeon/dr-garry-kitay-md\" target=\"_blank\">Garry Kitay, MD</a>, a hand, elbow and shoulder specialist at <a href=\"https://www.joionline.net/centers-of-expertise/hand-and-wrist/\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</a>.</p><p>The joints have very little soft tissue and over time, people can develop deformities in their hands, including cysts and swollen joints. This tends to be gradual and progressive, Dr. Kitay said.</p><p>Rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that is less common than osteoarthritis, often results in more dramatic symptoms of severe swelling pain and functional loss.</p><p>The CDC reports that 1 in 25 working-age adults aged 18 to 64 years face work limitations they attribute to arthritis.</p><p>In some cases, injuries can also result in post-traumatic arthritis later in life.</p><p>&ldquo;Just like stretching before and after your run, there are stretching exercises you can do with your hands and fingers before and after your normal daily activities,&rdquo; Dr. Kitay said. &ldquo;In the morning, it tends to be worse because swelling occurs more when you are sleeping and not using your hand.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Steps you can take to ease arthritis symptoms</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Warm the joints</strong>. Running your hands under hot water, soaking them in warm water or using a heating pad can help in the morning with swelling and soothing stiff joints.</li><li><strong>Use over-the-counter medications</strong>. Nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen can help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain.</li><li><strong>Stabilize your joints</strong>. Using a hand splint can stabilize your joint and help reduce pain and swelling. Custom-molded splints made specifically for your hand are also an option.</li><li><strong>Use adaptive equipment</strong>. Some equipment can help enhance performance of daily activities, including products to help opening jars or special grips made for utensils or pens.</li><li><strong>Exercise your hand and fingers</strong>. Hand therapy or daily exercises are essential. One exercise you can try is to repeatedly make a fist with your thumb on the outside, and then stretch out your hand and fingers. Another is to extend each joint of your digits individually. Use your other hand and bend each joint in each finger.</li></ul><p>If these options are not helpful, you may consider going to an orthopedic surgeon to have steroid injections up to several times a year, if effective.</p><p>Minimally invasive surgical approaches are also available if other steps are not successful. Similar to replacing a hip, joints in the hand, including the base of thumb, can be replaced. The bad joint can be removed and a new joint added using either your own &ldquo;spare&rdquo; tendons in your wrist or forearm or using an implant made of synthetic material such silicone, Dr. Kitay said. Another option is to fuse the bad joint by bonding the two bones on either side of it.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a cure for arthritis, but we do have ways to help people deal with the pain,&rdquo; Dr. Kitay said. &ldquo;Be aware of your body and your symptoms. Don&rsquo;t feel you have to suffer in silence. Take care of it like everything else. You take care of your heart. You should take care of your joints as well.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you have hand pain and over-the-counter medications are not working, you may want to consider seeing an orthopedist and hand specialist.

This type of cancer is slightly more common in men than women,</p><p>&ldquo;Pancreatic cancer is cancer of a small organ located behind the stomach,&rdquo; explained <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/hematologist-oncologist/dr-robert-zaiden-md\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Zaiden, MD,&nbsp;</a>a GI Medical Oncologist with Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center. &ldquo;Along with other things, the pancreas is responsible for the production of hormones and enzymes that help with digestion of food and control of blood sugar.&rdquo;</p><p>Although there are several different types of pancreatic cancers, the most common type (by far) is that of the exocrine pancreas.</p><p>&ldquo;It remains a highly lethal malignancy, and is the fourth-leading cause of cancer in the U.S., despite accounting for only 3 percent of cancers overall,&rdquo; explained Dr. Zaiden.</p><p>While some risk factors for pancreatic cancer can&rsquo;t be changed, such as age, gender, race and family history, some risk factors can be controlled. Smoking, being overweight and exposure to certain chemicals can increase a person&rsquo;s risk.</p><p><strong>Symptoms of pancreatic cancer&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)</li><li>Pain in the upper or middle abdomen and back</li><li>Unexpected weight loss</li><li>Loss of appetite</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Depression</li><li>Blood clots</li><li>Gallbladder or liver enlargement</li><li>Diabetes</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Think these symptoms are vague? You&rsquo;re right. Because the symptoms for pancreatic cancer are nonspecific, most cases are diagnosed in an advanced stage.</p><p>But we&rsquo;re rooting for Trebek. According to Dr. Zaiden, complete surgical removal offers the most likely chance of a cure if the tumor has not spread.</p><p>&ldquo;I plan to beat the low survival rate statistics for this disease,&rdquo; said Trebek in a hopeful tone in the video. &ldquo;Truth told, I have to!

You need him or her &ndash; and sometimes a full team of medical professionals &ndash; to help you manage the health crisis. Reducing stress is easier said than done but <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-george-royal-phd\" target=\"_blank\">George Royal, PhD,</a> chief of psychology at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville and Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center, offers 9 ways you can keep a cool head and manage that &ldquo;all-of-a-sudden&rdquo; stress in the health care environment:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>W</strong><strong>rite it down</strong>. Communicating under immense stress can be a challenge. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re anxious, stressed or depressed, it&rsquo;s very difficult to remember things,&rdquo; explained Dr. Royal. &ldquo;Take a moment to write all of your questions down so when you have time with the doctor, you can remember what you need to know.&rdquo; He also recommends bringing a friend or family member for support and repeating complicated information back to the care team to make sure you understand correctly. You can always ask for their information in writing, as well.Communicate your needs. Have a problem? There are three ways to express frustration but only one actually leads to a positive outcome.</li><li><strong>Communicate your needs</strong>. Have a problem? There are three ways to express frustration but only one actually leads to a positive outcome. (1) Take a passive approach. In this situation, you do not express your concerns, but rather walk away and do nothing. This often leads to more frustration and stress. It doesn&rsquo;t get your concern addressed. (2) Take an aggressive approach. This is when your frustration turns into anger and leads to negative behaviors such as yelling, cursing and name calling. This behavior leads to increased stress, miscommunication and resistance for others to help you with your need. It often compounds the problem you are trying to solve. (3) Use an assertive approach. It&rsquo;s the most effective way of expressing concern and it&rsquo;s also the most likely approach to lead to better outcomes. This involves simply stating your questions, concerns, needs and/or feelings in a calm and direct manner.</li><li><strong>Know your resources or ask for help</strong>. &ldquo;At Baptist Health, we have 24-hour support for the emotional aspects of the health care experience,&rdquo; said Dr. Royal. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to care for you in body, mind and spirit.&rdquo; Ask to speak with a chaplain, psychologist or social worker. They&rsquo;re there for you and your loved ones.</li><li><strong>Stay active</strong>. If it&rsquo;s a loved one in the hospital or you&rsquo;re able to stay active, do it! Most hospitals have courtyards or healing gardens so you can take a walk and get some fresh air.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Google</strong>. You&rsquo;re searching &ldquo;foot pain&rdquo; and all of a sudden, you&rsquo;ve landed on a webpage that makes you think your lateral cuneiform may have an isolated injury of direct trauma. This isn&rsquo;t helpful to your stress and anxiety, and it&rsquo;s likely not true. Diagnoses are individualized so skip Google and talk to a doc.</li><li><strong>Catch your ZZs</strong>. Take care of yourself by trying to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep. If you have to stay at the hospital, bring a comfort item from home like your own pillow or blanket. A sleeping mask and earplugs may also help.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Focus on the positives</strong>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier said than done but it makes the biggest difference,&rdquo; said Dr. Royal. &ldquo;Surround yourself with positive people and do your best to think about the good things in life rather than dwelling upon the negatives.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Bring a friend</strong>. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go alone to appointments that make you anxious,&rdquo; said Dr. Royal. &ldquo;I encourage my patients to bring a friend to medical appointments. They can help you stay calm and provide support in times of stress.&rdquo;</li><li>Have a distraction. Waiting rooms are no fun, but sometimes waiting is inevitable. &ldquo;Phones are a blessing and a curse. Avoid Google and play fun games or watch Netflix,&rdquo; encouraged Dr. Royal. &ldquo;Bring a book. Do a crossword puzzle. The point is, have something to help you pass the time.&rdquo;</li></ol><p>&ldquo;Breathe. Sit. Plan,&rdquo; advised Dr. Royal. &ldquo;Stress and anxiety occur when we feel like we&rsquo;ve lost control. Know which areas you can control, follow the steps above, and trust your physicians, nurses and health care team to take care of the rest.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Baptist Health values your mental and emotional health as key components of your overall health.

It got to where the avid angler couldn&rsquo;t stand on his fishing dock for any length of time due to chronic hip pain.</p><p>Maloy tried to grin and bear it for several months, relying on a growing collection of walking canes and ice packs. When the pain in his left hip became insufferable, he sought medical advice from his <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a> physician, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-david-page-md\" target=\"_blank\">David Page</a>, MD.</p><p>&ldquo;He gave me a steroid injection and I felt like 19 again for three days,&rdquo; said Maloy, a former barefoot water-skier in his youth. &ldquo;Then the pain came back with a vengeance.&rdquo;</p><p>A follow-up MRI revealed degenerative damage to the highest part of the thigh bone, called the femoral head, along with the hip socket. Foy was referred to an orthopedic surgeon with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/jacksonville-orthopaedic-institute\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Orthopedic Institute</a> who recommended total hip replacement surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;They said I was the perfect candidate for it,&rdquo; added Maloy. &ldquo;I told them to schedule me as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>Hip replacement is a surgical procedure where the hip joint is replaced by a prosthetic implant. In a total hip replacement, both the femoral head and the hip joint are replaced.</p><p>Maloy underwent total hip replacement surgery on Nov. 7, 2018, at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-nassau\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Nassau</a>.

I was basically crippled for 14 months, but surgery and rehab have rebuilt my self-confidence.&rdquo;</p><p>Two days after returning to work, Maloy penned an editorial about his hip surgery on the paper&rsquo;s opinion page. &ldquo;The procedure is amazing: An hour of surgery, an 11-centimeter incision, and an overnight stay in the hospital,&rdquo; the editorial said. &ldquo;We are fortunate to have such incredible medical resources right here in our community.&rdquo;</p><p>As for his collection of walking canes, Maloy said they&rsquo;re gathering dust in a bedroom corner.</p><p>&ldquo;And those ice packs are taking up way too much room in the freezer,&rdquo; he said with a chuckle.</p><p><em>The surgeons of&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/orthopedics/joint-replacement\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</em></a><em>&nbsp;perform joint procedures at the Baptist Center for Joint Replacement.</em></p>",

Like when First Lady Nancy Reagan was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1987. Surveys showed more people were influenced to contact a health professional and get their first mammogram based on Mrs. Reagan&rsquo;s experience.</p><p>The late former Apple CEO Steve Jobs&rsquo; diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer raised awareness about that rare cancer and pancreatic cancer in general.</p><p>And when Angelina Jolie announced being she was a BRCA1 carrier -- which put her at a higher risk for breast and ovarian cancer -- and then had a double mastectomy in 2013, there was what media dubbed &ldquo;The Angelina Jolie Effect,&rdquo; leading to a spike in genetic testing.</p><p>&ldquo;We definitely see an uptick in breast cancer screenings and diagnosis after celebrities reveal their breast cancer journeys,&rdquo; said breast surgeon <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/general-surgeon/dr-beth-lesnikoski-md\" target=\"_blank\">Beth-Ann Lesnikoski, MD</a>, director of the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center/breast-cancer\" target=\"_blank\">Breast Program at Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>. &ldquo;Some patients feel as if they know a celebrity and identify with parts of the celebrity&rsquo;s life, and the media doesn&rsquo;t report too much on regular people getting breast cancer and what those individuals do.&rdquo;</p><p>For the most part, Dr. Lesnikoski said it is helpful when celebrities speak out, but it can be a concern if a patient only relies on TV sound bytes from the media.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for patients to see a professional, get fully educated about their disease, and make treatment choices that are tailored to them as an individual and a whole person,&rdquo; she added.</p><p>Dr. Lesnikoski encourages these steps be taken if someone is diagnosed with cancer:</p><ul><li><strong>Get educated</strong>. See a specialist in your specific cancer type and get a second opinion if you feel that you need more information, or if you don&rsquo;t feel like you will have a good connection with the first doctor you consult.</li><li><strong>Ask questions</strong>. &ldquo;There are no stupid questions. Your caregiver should treat you with respect and listen to your concerns and questions,&rdquo; she said.</li><li><strong>Assemble a team</strong>. Breast cancer is almost never an emergency. You have time to get educated and to assemble a team, said Dr. Lesnikoski. You will typically need a surgeon, a medical oncologist and a radiation oncologist. &ldquo;Make sure you understand what each one does and what his or her final recommendations are,&rdquo; she said. &quot;You may need a plastic surgeon as well, especially if you want reconstruction after total mastectomy, or if a cosmetic repair is needed for women with larger tumors who want to conserve their breast.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>When it comes to a double mastectomy, Dr. Lesnikoski said it generally only has a survival benefit for patients like Jolie who have high-risk breast cancer genes that tend to cause aggressive breast cancers at a younger age than is typical for non-genetic breast cancer. Fewer than 5 percent of patients diagnosed with breast cancer will carry a high-risk mutation, she said. Double mastectomy is not recommended for other groups, she added.</p><p>Various new treatments are providing hope for patients with triple-negative breast cancer, which typically doesn&rsquo;t respond to traditional hormone therapy, or HER2 -positive breast cancer, which has too much of the protein HER2 and is aggressive and fast growing.</p><p>Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center offers a number of clinical trials for various cancers, including breast cancer, especially triple-negative breast cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We have options for immunotherapy, (which uses the body&rsquo;s own immune system to help fight cancer). We also are testing innovative technologies to reduce the chances of finding cancer cells at the edge of the surgical specimen after a lumpectomy,&rdquo; Dr. Lesnikoski said. &ldquo;For patients with triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer, we offer a clinical trial that eliminates breast surgery for those who have no evidence of the disease left in the breast after up-front chemotherapy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Baptist MD Anderson also offers genetic testing and genetic counseling services to help assess patients and their family members for inherited cancer syndromes or cancer predisposition.</p><p><strong>When to seek genetic testing</strong></p><ul><li>You or someone else in your family has been diagnosed with cancer under the age of 50.</li><li>You or someone else in your family has developed the same type of cancer more than once, a rare cancer or multiple types of cancer.</li><li>Someone in your family has been diagnosed with bilateral cancers (in both paired organs such as both breasts or kidneys).</li><li>You have a family member who has been identified as having a hereditary cancer syndrome, which can be the case for breast, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, melanoma, colorectal, uterine and other cancers.</li></ul><p><em>If you are concerned about your risk for breast cancer, talk to your primary care doctor or OB/GYN.</em></p>",

Seemingly healthy and only 52 years old, his death provokes questions about who is vulnerable to stroke and whether it is common in middle age.</p><p>&ldquo;The older we get, the higher our risk of stroke is. But anyone can have a stroke, including babies and toddlers,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-eric-sauvageau-md\">Eric Sauvageau, MD,</a> director of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-center\">Baptist Stroke and Cerebrovascular Center.</a> &ldquo;Many of our patients are in their 50s.&rdquo;</p><p>There are some risk factors that are out of your control, such as family history. Race and gender also play a role &ndash; females and African Americans are at higher risk.</p><p>The good news is that there are risk factors you can control. Here are some lifestyle guidelines from the National Stroke Association:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Know your blood pressure. High blood pressure is a leading cause of stroke.</li><li>Find out if you have atrial fibrillation (commonly known as AFib). Your doctor can detect AFib, a heart rhythm disorder, by carefully checking your pulse.</li><li>If you smoke, stop. It doubles your risk for stroke.</li><li>If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation.</li><li>Know your cholesterol number. Lowering it may reduce your stroke risk.</li><li>Control your diabetes. This condition can increases risk for stroke.</li><li>Exercise daily. As little as 30 minutes of exercise a day can improve your health and may reduce your risk of stroke.</li><li>Eat a low-sodium (salt), lower-fat diet. Cutting down on salt will lower your blood pressure and risk for stroke.</li><li>Ask your doctor if you have circulation problems.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Hernias are more common than you might think, and many people don&rsquo;t even know they have one.</p><p>About 5 percent of the population will have a hernia at some point in their lives, and there are an estimated 3 million new hernia cases diagnosed every year in the U.S.</p><p><strong>What is a hernia?</strong></p><p>A hernia is a hole in the muscle wall of the abdomen that can affect anyone at any age &ndash; men, women and even children. &nbsp;In adults, they &nbsp;often occur in areas of previous surgical scars, the umbilical area or in the groin.</p><p>There are many different types of hernias, but they all occur when pressure pushes body tissue (usually an intestine) through a weak spot in the muscle wall. The most common type is an inguinal hernia, which occurs in the groin area.</p><p>For some, a telltale symptom may be a bulge in the abdomen but even that isn&rsquo;t always apparent.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Many people with hernias have very few symptoms,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/general-surgeon/dr-thomas-austgen-md\">Thomas Austgen, MD,</a> a general surgeon at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-beaches\">Baptist Medical Center Beaches.</a> &ldquo;There are a number of people who have hernias and don&rsquo;t even realize it.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Silent signs</strong><br>Common signs of a hernia on the abdominal wall that frequently get overlooked include:</p><ul><li>Pain in the pelvic area, especially burning pain</li><li>Nausea</li><li>Constipation</li><li>Weakness and muscle fatigue in the upper leg or groin</li><li>Feeling full and bloated</li><li>Pain when lifting or coughing<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re experiencing any of these symptoms on a regular basis, it&rsquo;s important to schedule an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-matthew-modansky-md\">Matthew Modansky, MD,</a> a family physician at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\">Baptist Primary Care</a> in Neptune Beach.<br>While the vast majority of hernia patients are men, women can have them, too. They&rsquo;re sometimes are mistaken for fibroids, ovarian cysts or endometriosis. &ldquo;If a woman is experiencing pelvic pain, she shouldn&rsquo;t rule out the possibility of a hernia,&rdquo; said Dr. Modansky. Between 2 and 5 percent of all women will develop a hernia in their lifetime.</li></ul><p>A simple physical exam can usually determine if you have a hernia. In some cases, a CT scan may also be required. &ldquo;Getting an early diagnosis is important,&rdquo; said Dr. Modansky. &ldquo;Some hernias can become strangulated, which means that the blood supply is cut off from the herniated tissue. This is considered a medical emergency.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Repairing a hernia</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, a hernia will not heal on its own. &ldquo;Surgery is the most durable way to treat a hernia,&rdquo; said Dr. Austgen. He recommends having surgery early on, before the hernia enlarges.</p><p>Today&rsquo;s hernia repair options include procedures that are less invasive with faster recovery. These procedures can usually be done on an outpatient basis, which means no overnight hospital stay. Patients are usually able to shower the next day, and return to work three to five days after surgery.</p><p>Dr. Austgen said the likelihood of getting a hernia again once you&rsquo;ve had it repaired is very low. He encourages patients to choose a surgeon who has a solid success record of hernia repair and has done them for a number of years.</p><p>Hernias can be caused by anything that increases pressure in the abdomen, such as heavy lifting, persistent coughing or sneezing or constipation. Rapid weight gain or pregnancy can also cause hernias.</p><p><strong>Tips to reduce your chance of developing a hernia</strong></p><ul><li>Maintain an ideal body weight through healthy diet and exercise.</li><li>Eat enough fruits, vegetables and whole grains to avoid constipation.</li><li>Bend your knees rather than bending forward when lifting heavy objects.</li><li>Avoid lifting anything that is beyond your ability.</li><li>See a doctor if you&rsquo;re coughing persistently.</li><li>Stop smoking &ndash; it can lead to coughing that may trigger a hernia</li></ul><p><br></p><p><em>Visit <a href=\"http://baptisthernia.com\">baptisthernia.com</a> to learn more about hernia prevention and repair.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Newborns spend their days eating, sleeping and making dirty diapers, and with only three activities to try each day, each one carries a lot of importance. Parents of newborns will have many questions about what their baby should be eating, how much and when, and those questions will continue as baby grows and changes.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatrician/dr-shiree-sauer-md\" target=\"_blank\">Shiree Sauer, MD</a>, a pediatrician with Baptist Primary Care in Orange Park, suggests parents keep a record of how much their baby eats in 24 hours rather than each individual feeding. Making sure they&rsquo;re eating enough overall will help them gain weight healthily.</p><p>&ldquo;There are minimum amounts a child is expected to gain at certain age benchmarks, and it&rsquo;s more telling to track how much they&rsquo;re eating over 24 hours,&rdquo; said Dr. Sauer. &ldquo;There was a study done with a group of babies solely nursed from the breast, babies fed breastmilk from a bottle, and formula-fed babies.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The babies who did best were actually the ones who were nursed. A nursing mom doesn&rsquo;t have any clue how much the baby is eating because the baby is completely in charge of how much they&rsquo;re eating. In this case, from day one, they&rsquo;re controlling their own hunger. Try to simulate that feeding on demand by always making a half an ounce more than the baby usually eats when bottle-feeding. They may stop eating and be satisfied before they finish, or they may be hungrier and eat it all.&rdquo;</p><p>Many babies are developmentally ready to try solids around 4 months old, but your baby&rsquo;s pediatrician can offer expert guidance on when your baby should make the transition. He or she will know when your baby is physically developed enough to safely consume solids; until then, breastmilk or formula provide all of the nutrients needed for growth.</p><p>When offering solid foods, make sure they are soft, blended textures. Infants shouldn&#39;t eat hot dogs, nuts, round candies, grapes, popcorn, or hard fruits and vegetables because they all are choking hazards for little ones.</p><p>One surprise is the newer recommendation from doctors not to avoid potentially allergy-triggering foods until babies are older. Studies show early exposure to peanuts, eggs, fish and strawberries decreases the risk of developing allergies.</p><p>&ldquo;I think the major change has been more about the incorporation of what had been foods to stay away from to being incorporated at an earlier age. It used to be with foods like eggs, fish, nuts and strawberries, physicians would encourage moms not to introduce these foods until the baby was a year or older,&rdquo; said Dr. Sauer. &ldquo;Many recent studies have been done on this, and it has been found that even in children who have a genetic predisposition to allergies, introducing these foods before six months decreases their chances of developing food allergies.&rdquo; Your baby&#39;s pediatrician can advise you on how to introduce these foods.</p><p>One thing to keep away from baby until after he or she turns 1: honey, which can carry bacteria called Clostridium botulinum. This dangerous bacteria can cause botulism when it enters a baby&#39;s developing digestive system.</p><p><em>If you have questions or concerns about your baby&rsquo;s eating habits, make an appointment with&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/patient-info/online-scheduling\" target=\"_blank\"><em>a pediatrician at a Baptist Primary Care</em></a><em>&nbsp;location near you or call 904.202.4YOU (4968).</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Medicine is always changing, evolving and advancing. But as scientists discover new information, sometimes long-held beliefs are debunked. For example, we used to believe children could outgrow asthma with age, but as any adult patient with asthma knows, that&rsquo;s not always true.</p><p>&ldquo;Most beliefs about health are generated from things we&rsquo;re told by family members and friends, and even sometimes physicians,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-nicole-harris-md\" target=\"_blank\">Nicole Harris, MD</a>, a family physician with Baptist Primary Care on the Southbank. &ldquo;Today, patients will look up conditions and treatments for themselves, so that&rsquo;s helping to debunk some of the misleading information out there.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Harris is asked about many of the same health care myths by her own patients. She debunks four of the most common here:</p><p><strong>1. Vaccines are risky.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Definitely, the first myth is related to vaccines, particularly the flu vaccine.</p><p>&ldquo;I hear at least once a day that the flu vaccine causes you to get the flu, or, &lsquo;My family member told me they got the flu shot and it gave them the flu,&rsquo;&rdquo; Dr. Harris said. &ldquo;I try to talk to patients about their fear of vaccines. We assure them that the flu virus is not a live virus and does not cause the flu. The idea of vaccines being dangerous came from the theory that they can cause autism. We now have data that disprove this theory.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Harris explained that some patients experience symptoms similar to flu, like fatigue, following their vaccination. This isn&rsquo;t actually the flu virus, but rather the body&rsquo;s immune response to getting the injection.</p><p><strong>2. You can detoxify your body with a detox diet or tea.</strong></p><p>Do the Kardashians swear by them? Yes. But physicians say detox teas and diets aren&rsquo;t going to help much.</p><p>&ldquo;Our bodies are pretty darn good at getting rid of toxins already &mdash; they are made to get rid of toxins. If they want to detox, I tell patients the best way is to limit the processed foods they&rsquo;re eating and replace them with whole foods,&rdquo; Dr. Harris explained. &ldquo;Stop reintroducing those toxins to your body because none of those detoxifying diets or teas has been proven to actually flush toxins out of the body&rdquo;</p><p>In fact, check with your physician before trying any detox teas or supplements at home to be safe.</p><p>&ldquo;For patients with chronic conditions, the ingredients of those diets or teas may even be harmful to them.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>3. Green mucus means a bacterial infection; clear mucus means a virus.</strong></p><p>A patient comes in because of cold symptoms after one day, but they&rsquo;ll say I came in for an antibiotic because what I coughed up was green stuff.</p><p>&ldquo;I tell patients all the time the formulation of mucus when you get sick is our body&rsquo;s immune system trying to fight off infection, whether it&rsquo;s viral or bacterial,&rdquo; explained Dr. Harris. &ldquo;It can be clear with viral, green with bacterial or vice versa &mdash; there is no definitive association. There have been studies that have shown green mucus is slightly more common with bacterial infections, but having that feature does not equal a bacterial infection.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>4. Cold weather makes you sick.</strong></p><p>Of course, it&rsquo;s important (and more comfortable) to bundle up when there&rsquo;s a chill in the air. But forgetting your hat or scarf won&rsquo;t cause you to come down with a cold that evening.</p><p>&ldquo;In cold weather, certain viruses are more prevalent than at other times. When you&rsquo;re out and about and you&rsquo;re exposed to people with viruses and it happens to be cold, you assume it&rsquo;s the cold weather making you sick when it&rsquo;s more likely that you were exposed to someone with a virus,&rdquo; Dr. Harris said.</p><p>Those who are looking for the most accurate health information should make sure they&rsquo;re using reliable sources that are updated often.</p><p>&ldquo;WebMD is not a bad place to start because I think they try to keep their information up-to-date,&rdquo; said Dr. Harris. &ldquo;Patients can then follow up with their primary care physician to confirm they&rsquo;ve read about is a recommended practice.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Dr. Harris, the safest place to ask for accurate health information &mdash; even if you believe you know the answer &mdash; is to ask your doctor.</p><p>&ldquo;We as physicians &ndash; as we read and get new information from studies &ndash; we&rsquo;re able to change how we treat and inform patients about different conditions. Medicine is always evolving, so how we diagnose and treat conditions changes over time. How we treated something five years ago may be totally different now.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you need a primary care physician to help you navigate through health facts vs. health myths, call <strong>202.4YOU</strong> or visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/patient-info/online-scheduling\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Primary Care</em></a><em>&nbsp;to make an appointment.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Curtis Dvorak, co-host of <em>First Coast Living</em> on First Coast News and the original Jaxson DeVille mascot for the Jacksonville Jaguars for 19+ years, has always believed in living in the present. His watch displays only one time: NOW. It&rsquo;s never slow, it&rsquo;s never fast, and it&rsquo;s accurate in every time zone.</p><p>So it&rsquo;s no surprise that even when he learned he would be a first-time father, he planned to focus on the now. Son Dax was born July 19, 2018.</p><p>Of course, it&rsquo;s expected that a new baby will cause a little bit of worry and new parents might need a visit or two to the pediatrician or the ER in the first months.</p><p>Still, Curtis and his wife Jasmine weren&rsquo;t prepared for the news they received that could impact their family&rsquo;s future.</p><p>They had taken two-month-old Dax to the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s ER due to breathing issues on September 20, 2018. There, the baby was diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common respiratory illness in infants, and Dax was admitted to the fourth floor of Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>Around midday, pediatric hospitalist Kuo Chen, MD, examined the baby and told the new parents he believed he heard a heart murmur.</p><p>&ldquo;It was 2 am and we were exhausted,&rdquo; said Curtis. &ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s why I said this, but I told him we had been to the pediatrician and Dax was already two months old, so how could he have a heart murmur if he had been to the doctor?&rdquo;</p><p>Still, Dr. Chen insisted on ordering an echocardiogram for Dax to rule out a heart defect.</p><p><strong>A shocking heart diagnosis</strong></p><p>Curtis and Jasmine weren&rsquo;t expecting the worst. Even when UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville pediatric cardiologist Andrea Kropf, MD, came into their son&rsquo;s room, they still thought Dax had nothing more than RSV.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Kropf went over the different things [a heart murmur] could mean,&rdquo; remembered Curtis. &ldquo;She mentioned that it could mean Dax had a partial or complete AVCD (atrioventricular canal defect).&rdquo;</p><p>An AVCD is a complex heart condition that occurs when the valves and muscle walls separating the heart&#39;s chambers don&rsquo;t form completely while a baby is still in the womb. It is comprised of three heart defects: a hole in the heart wall (septum) that separates the upper chambers of the heart, called an atrial septal defect; a hole in the septum that separates the lower chambers of the heart, called a ventricular septal defect; and when the heart has one large valve between the atrium and ventricles instead of the normal two.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Kropf said that a partial AVCD could be treated with medication and might resolve on its own,&rdquo; said Curtis. &ldquo;With a complete, it would require open-heart surgery.&rdquo;</p><p>While the couple awaited the results of the echocardiogram, Curtis had already convinced himself and Jasmine that if their son had a heart defect, it would be &ldquo;partial&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;complete.&rdquo;</p><p>But when Dr. Kropf pulled up the echocardiogram results, Curtis&rsquo;s own heart sank. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that much about the heart, but what I do know is there should be two chambers and four ventricles, and when I saw the echo results, I saw what looked like one chamber,&rdquo; he remembered.</p><p><strong>Pediatric cardiologist: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s complete.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>&ldquo;We felt helpless, like we couldn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; Curtis said.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Kropf told Curtis and Jasmine that a surgical repair of Dax&rsquo;s heart defects would have to wait at least six weeks so he could recover from the RSV. He needed to be as strong as possible in order to have open-heart surgery to address his serious cardiac condition.</p><p>Fortunately, Michael Shillingford, MD, chief of Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery at Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital, and Eric Ceithaml, MD, both <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/heart/heart-surgery\" target=\"_blank\">pediatric cardiothoracic surgeons at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>, were able to schedule Dax for surgery December 6. They would be joined by a new partner with additional expertise in heart canal defects like what the Dvoraks&#39; son had: Victor Morell, MD, chief of the Division of Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery at <a href=\"http://www.chp.edu/our-services/heart\">UPMC Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Pittsburgh</a>.</p><p>That very month, Wolfson Children&rsquo;s had officially become a partner in the UPMC Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Pittsburgh Heart Institute Network, bringing additional heart surgery expertise from the #6 ranked Best Children&rsquo;s Hospital in the nation for pediatric cardiology and heart surgery to children in the North Florida/South Georgia region and beyond.</p><p>&ldquo;Jasmine and I were happy to learn that the best minds in pediatric heart surgery in our region and in Pittsburgh were coming together to review Dax&rsquo;s case,&rdquo; said Curtis.</p><p><strong>Giving Dax&rsquo;s heart surgery team a &ldquo;pep talk&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Once Dax was given a surgery date, Curtis and Jasmine&rsquo;s lives became a blur of pre-op tests. At their first visit with Dr. Shillingford, they came prepared with a number of questions. Dr. Shillingford answered them all in his calm, collected &ndash; but also particularly compassionate &ndash; manner.</p><p>&ldquo;When I met the Dvoraks, I knew right away that they were a loving, smart and informed family who wanted to know everything they needed to know about their son&rsquo;s very complex congenital heart condition,&rdquo; said Dr. Shillingford. &ldquo;I am always honored to have the opportunity to impact the future of children like Dax and families like the Dvoraks.&rdquo;</p><p>When Curtis asked during Dax&rsquo;s pre-op visit if he could give a &ldquo;pep talk&rdquo; to the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital heart team, Dr. Shillingford was more than willing to make that happen.</p><p>Still, the day of surgery, Curtis was at a rare loss for words. In the holding room waiting for Dax to be taken back for surgery, he paced while his baby boy slept peacefully in Jasmine&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>&ldquo;I was trying not to think,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then Dr. Shillingford walked into our room and said, &lsquo;You wanted to say something to the team?&rsquo; And he brought in the cardiac anesthesiologist and nurses, and all I could think to say was, &lsquo;We love you guys and we believe in you guys. And you are going to do the best surgery you&rsquo;ve ever done in your lives.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The Wolfson Children&rsquo;s team members were touched by Curtis and Jasmine&rsquo;s demonstration of trust in them. Curtis remembered, &ldquo;The nurse who would be our main contact throughout surgery said, &lsquo;This is my baby now. We will treat him as if he is our own.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Parents camp out on Cardiovascular ICU</strong></p><p>While Dax was in the surgery, the Dvoraks were updated on a regular basis by the cardiac nurse. Dax recovered on the Cardiovascular ICU (CVICU) for only eight days before being discharged home. He is healing remarkably well. Now seven months old, he is a happy, inquisitive healthy boy who charms anyone who meets him.</p><p>What Curtis and Jasmine remember most of all of their experience &ndash; besides what Curtis calls their &ldquo;Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital campout&rdquo; in Dax&rsquo;s room on the CVICU &ndash; is the professionalism and compassion of the team.</p><p>&ldquo;The entire process, start to finish, was amazing,&rdquo; said Curtis. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t say enough about how good they were, how professional they were. Their matter-of-factness was calming. They reassured us that &lsquo;We do this a lot.&rsquo; We are so grateful to the team at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and to Dr. Morell for what they have done for Dax and for our family.&rdquo;</p>",

If you&rsquo;re having a hard time controlling your urine, you&rsquo;re not alone.</p><p>But there&rsquo;s hope.</p><p>&ldquo;Many of the issues causing incontinence can be fixed or improved through non-invasive means like physical therapy or medication,&rdquo; said Donna Roth, PT, a pelvic health therapist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/rehabilitation-centers\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Rehabilitation</a>.</p><p>The first step to treatment is knowing the cause.</p><p><strong>Leaking with everyday activity?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Stress incontinence occurs with activities that increase abdominal pressure. If severe enough, it can occur with simple activities such as bending or walking. This is due to weakness of the bladder neck, which maintains the seal of urine while you move, and pelvic floor muscles. Behavior modification, weight loss and pelvic floor rehab can help improve and resolve these symptoms.</p><p><strong>Got the urge to purge?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Overactive bladder can cause frequent urination and a sudden, uncontrollable urge to go. Bladder spasms resulting from many factors including nerve dysfunction can cause this condition. Primary treatments for overactive bladder are behavioral modifications and medications. Pelvic floor rehab can also help.</p><p><strong>Injury or chronic condition?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>These issues can damage the nerves that help signal the need to urinate, decreasing your ability to sense when your bladder is full. The result is frequent urination and leaking. Treatments include pelvic floor rehab, electrical stimulation of bladder nerves and urinary catheterization.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Time for a prostate exam?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>An enlarged prostate can block the flow of urine, causing urine leaking or dribbling, urgency, retention and incontinence. Treatments for prostate cancer can also affect bladder function. Radiation damage to nerves or muscles, and prostatectomy (surgical removal of the prostate) may result in incontinence. However, men with post-prostatectomy incontinence will benefit from pelvic floor rehab. Pelvic floor rehab prior to prostatectomy (also known as &ldquo;prehab&rdquo;) can improve bladder function after the procedure.</p><p>&ldquo;The most important thing for patients to remember is that there is no reason to be embarrassed by urinary incontinence,&rdquo; said Roth. &ldquo;Ignoring the problem can cause it to become worse and treatment is typically more effective when started early on.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Baptist Rehabilitation Services offer a variety of individualized programs to treat both male and female incontinence.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>In 1991, Al Stallings was invited to perform on &ldquo;Showtime at the Apollo,&rdquo; a nationally televised talent show airing from the famous Apollo Theater in New York City.</p><p>His song choice was the pop standard &ldquo;Always and Forever&rdquo; by Heatwave, a funk-disco band.</p><p>&ldquo;It was one of my signature songs,&rdquo; recalled Stallings, an amateur singer who first noticed he could carry a tune in the fourth grade. &ldquo;But I messed up big time at the Apollo.&rdquo;</p><p>Stallings lost his place in the 1978 hit song, and was unceremoniously booed by the Apollo&rsquo;s notoriously tough crowd. In those days, contestants who bombed were escorted off the stage by C.P. &ldquo;Sandman&rdquo; Lacey, the Harlem&rsquo;s theater&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;talent executioner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I went to the high part of the song too soon and the band didn&rsquo;t go with me,&rdquo; Stallings said. &ldquo;Next thing I know, a siren is going off and the Sandman is coming to get me, but that never stopped me from singing again.&rdquo;</p><p>Neither did a diagnosis of breast cancer at age 58.</p><p><strong>Self-exam not just for women</strong></p><p>According to the American Cancer Society, family history can increase the risk of breast cancer in men, particularly if other men in the family have had breast cancer.</p><p>In Stallings&rsquo; case, his son, AJ, was diagnosed with breast cancer first, after noticing his right nipple leaking fluid. Nipple discharge is one symptom of breast cancer in men. Other symptoms include:</p><ul><li>A painless lump or thickening of your breast tissue</li><li>Changes in skin covering your breast, such as dimpling, puckering, redness or scaling</li><li>Changes to your nipple, such as redness or scaling, or a nipple that begins to turn inward</li></ul><p>&ldquo;After my son was diagnosed in May 2015, I starting checking myself for lumps and found some,&rdquo; said Stallings, who had a diagnostic mammogram at the Hill Breast Center at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>. &ldquo;I remember asking the receptionist where the mammogram line was for men.&rdquo;</p><p>Once a biopsy confirmed his diagnoses of stage 2 breast cancer, Stallings, a retired production support supervisor at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, ended up having the same surgery as his 34-year-old son, a double mastectomy. He also needed chemotherapy because the cancer had reached his lymph nodes.</p><p><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-draggable fr-bordered fr-dii fr-fil\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/c_scale,w_1049/v1551739784/Juice/gordon-polley-8x10.jpg\" alt=\"Polley\" style=\"width: 250px;\"></p><p>&ldquo;In AJ&#39;s case, we caught it a lot earlier because he had not developed a lump like his father,&rdquo; said general surgeon <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/general-surgeon/dr-gordon-polley-md\" target=\"_blank\">Gordon Polley, MD</a>, a faculty member of Baptist MD Anderson who treated both father and son.</p><p>&ldquo;Male breast cancer is treated the exact same way as female breast cancer. Men have the same risk factors as women.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Singing his caregiver&rsquo;s praises</strong></p><p>As part of his cancer treatment, Stallings developed a condition called lymphedema, caused by the removal of some of his lymph nodes. He wears a special, medical-grade compression sleeve on his right arm to help control swelling and is currently working with lymphedema specialists at Baptist MD Anderson, including medical oncologist <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/medical-oncologist/dr-john-vu-md\" target=\"_blank\">John Vu, MD</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;Everybody at Baptist MD Anderson was great. They treat you like royalty,&rdquo; Stallings said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say enough about the hospitality I received. They take the worry out of your mind.&rdquo;</p><p>During Black History Month, Stallings was invited to sing at a Martin Luther King Day observance at Baptist MD Anderson that was attended by a number of team members, including Dr. Vu.</p><p>Men make up less than 1 percent of all breast cancer cases in the U.S., according to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, but don&rsquo;t tell Stallings that.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Polley said he is starting to see more men being diagnosed with breast cancer,&rdquo; said Stallings. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proof and so is my son.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you or a loved one has recently discovered a lump in the breast, had a suspicious mammogram or been diagnosed with breast cancer, experts at&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</em></a><em>&nbsp;offer hope, compassion and expert care.</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><div style=\"position: relative; display: block; max-width: 100%;\"><div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"//players.brightcove.net/4709052668001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6005351003001\" allowfullscreen=\"\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div></div>",

There are steps you can take at a young age to help ensure you will be sharp and remember the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; to share with your grandchildren.</p><p><span style='font-family: \"Fauna One\", serif; font-size: 1.125em; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; background-color: initial; text-align: initial;'><strong>Where to start?</strong></span></p><p>&quot;Excessive e<span style='font-family: \"Fauna One\", serif; font-size: 1.125em; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; background-color: initial; text-align: initial;'>lectronic use can potentially hurt our brains,&rdquo; said neurologist Bryan Riggeal, MD, with Baptist Neurology. &ldquo;While nothing suggests that it causes dementia, it will contribute to attention/concentration problems, which commonly presents with memory loss.&rdquo;</span></p><p>Dr. Riggeal points to brain studies in Korea showing one or both sides of the brain can be improved with activities such as playing an instrument or participating in creative art. Concentration can be enhanced with activities such as learning a new language or reading books.</p><p>&ldquo;Some of these problems may also be related to relying too much on electronic devices rather than thinking about things. This might be offset by depending less on a quick Google search,&rdquo; Dr. Riggeal said.</p><p>Brain atrophy, or shrinking of the brain, is universal and there is no way to predict when it will start or how rapidly it will progress, Dr. Riggeal added.</p><p>&ldquo;Once the atrophy occurs, there is really nothing that can be done currently to reverse it. Therefore, there really isn&#39;t a time that&#39;s too early to start considering possible interventions/modifications in attempts to keep the mind sharp,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>While in your 20s, you should consider an active lifestyle and heart-healthy diet to lower your risks of dementia. Getting into the habit of using critical thinking skills may also stave off a decline.</p><p>&ldquo;We know that the No. 1 risk factor for dementia is age,&rdquo; Dr. Riggeal said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Since there is no real way to stop the aging process, all of the emphasis is on preventing the other, lesser important risk factors including sedentary lifestyle, lack of social interactions, and vascular risk factors (high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol problems).&rdquo;</p><p>Vascular problems contribute to cognitive issues, including dementia. Numerous studies published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health point to the importance of exercise at an early age to maintain a healthy brain. One study points to high-intensity cycling or long-term exercise of moderate intensity improving cognitive performance in young adults while regular exercise after 65 can also aid in reducing memory loss.</p><p>So, if you can stay active, social and heart healthy, you may be able to keep those memories around longer.</p><p>Taking these three extra steps may also help:</p><p>Keep your memory sharp: Memory training, learning to use memory clues, organizational aids and practicing inductive reasoning (critical thinking skills based on observations and experiences) have all been suggested at least in the short-term, according to Dr. Riggeal, to help with memory.</p><p>Watch what you eat: Dr. Riggeal points out that while no data convincingly states that any specific nutritional strategy can help prevent dementia, abnormal levels of some nutrients have been linked to a higher rate of dementia. There are many nutritional factors to Vitamin E, Vitamin C, selenium (a mineral found in the soil), Omega 3 fatty acids, various forms of the Mediterranean diet, B12, B6, folic acid, and others.</p><p>Get a good night&rsquo;s sleep: &ldquo;Sleep is crucial and can certainly contribute to memory problems by way of inattentiveness (termed pseudodementia),&rdquo; Dr. Riggeal said. Studies in mice have suggested that sleep problems could potentially increase the risk of dementia though high-quality studies have not clearly defined this.</p><p><em>Are you or a loved one having trouble with memory loss?

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>A recent study by the University of Keele and Academic Department of Cardiology at Royal Stoke Hospital in the United Kingdom found that people who are married appear to have a lower risk of heart disease. They analyzed data from 30 studies involving more than two million people, finding that those who weren&rsquo;t married were at a 42 percent higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease and a 16 percent higher risk of developing coronary artery disease compared to married people.</p><p>Coronary artery disease refers to narrowing of the arteries due to cholesterol deposits, and cardiovascular disease includes events like heart attack, heart failure, arrhythmias (heart rhythm disorders) and cardiomyopathy (enlarged or rigid heart).</p><p>While the majority of a person&rsquo;s risk for cardiovascular disease is caused by factors like genetics, high blood pressure or diabetes, researchers believe other factors like social networks or relationships also play a role in prevention.</p><p><strong>All you need is love</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-john-mooney-md\" target=\"_blank\">Houston Mooney, MD</a>, a cardiologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a> at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-nassau\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Nassau</a>, says that while this study may show marriage is great for prevention of heart disease, it&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint exactly why.</p><p>&ldquo;With data like these, causality is difficult to determine,&rdquo; he said, referencing the many reasons a romantic partnership may boost heart health. The study&rsquo;s researchers believe it may be because spouses hold each other accountable for their health and wellness. Dr. Mooney agrees.</p><p>&ldquo;Lifestyle changes are easier to make if you have someone who is trying to make those changes with you,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Couples in relationships may be more likely to eat at home, with planned, balanced meals rather than eating less healthy, on-the-go options. They&rsquo;re more likely to have children and, with such responsibility, many people find the determination to quit smoking or moderate their alcohol consumption in order better fulfill their parental duties and to keep from exposing their children to a potentially harmful environment.&rdquo;</p><p>Living together also means one partner is able to respond more rapidly to a heart-related crisis when it strikes the other.</p><p>&ldquo;We do know that in events where patients suffer cardiac arrest, massive heart attacks or fatal arrhythmias, unwitnessed events have a much worse prognosis,&rdquo; said Dr. Mooney. &ldquo;The key factor to survival in cardiac arrest is minimizing the time to effective CPR and, if needed, defibrillation (administering a controlled electric shock to restore normal heart rhythm). When an emergency event is witnessed, the times to treatment is typically much shorter.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1549920313/Juice/Couples_lower_heart_risk-2nd.jpg\" alt=\"Couple\"></div><p>Dr. Mooney adds that dual incomes in a marriage or domestic partnership may mean better access to health care, preventive care, and healthy diet and exercise options.</p><p>&ldquo;In my mind, with more money comes health insurance, the ability to afford medications and the ability to seek second opinions. Also, healthy food options can often be more expensive. Patients with means can afford gym memberships, personal trainers and to take time off from work if their health is in crisis.&rdquo;</p><p>So, marriage isn&rsquo;t exactly a magic pill. The key to a heart-healthy relationship is having a partner who supports healthy lifestyle choices and reduces stress. Partners provide emotional support, which can help decrease stress and blood pressure. &ldquo;Broken heart syndrome&rdquo; is a temporary condition that resembles a heart attack and is induced by stress.</p><p>While the study only used data from married heterosexual couples, Dr. Mooney hypothesizes that couples of any sexual orientation and marital status would likely experience the same reduced risks of heart disease.</p><p>&ldquo;Stress has detrimental effects on the body and it&rsquo;s easy to assume that healthy relationships have less stress,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Cortisol is one of the primary stress hormones in the body, and it plays a role in the regulation of blood sugar and blood pressure, both of which are significant risk factors for heart disease. While there are some risk factors that have been shown to be specific to the LGBTQ community, I think that many benefits of a healthy relationship can apply to all types of partners.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Single, separated or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Complicated&rdquo;</strong></p><p>If marriage reduces the risk of heart disease, what about those who are divorced? The study found that divorced participants had a 35 percent higher risk of developing heart disease compared to married people.</p><p>&ldquo;Solely based upon the numbers, it seems like any protective effect of marriage is nearly reversed by divorce,&rdquo; Dr. Mooney said. &ldquo;It seems logical that marriages that end in divorce are by nature unhealthy and thereby would not provide the benefits of a healthy relationship.&rdquo;</p><p>However, those who are single need not rush to find a partner just for the sake of a healthy heart. Friends and family can be just as helpful for emotional support as a partner.</p><p>&ldquo;I think the real focus should be on stress reduction and building community and accountability,&rdquo; said Dr. Mooney. &ldquo;I do think many of these benefits can apply to patients with good support systems.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you are concerned about your heart health, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\"><em>baptistjax.com/heart</em></a><em>&nbsp;to find a cardiologist near you.</em></p><p><em>Marriage and heart disease study: heart.bmj.com/content/104/23/1937&nbsp;</em></p>",

At 11 weeks, Marissa went in for routine testing and an ultrasound. After her OB expressed concern about an abnormal scan, she had a fetal echocardiogram, a more detailed ultrasound of a baby&rsquo;s heart, at 20 weeks. It was confirmed &ndash; their beloved baby had congenital heart disease (CHD).</p><p>Finn&rsquo;s specific condition is called Transposition of the Great Arteries (d-TGA), a condition in which the two main arteries carrying blood out of the heart are switched in position.</p><p>In a normal heart, the right side of the heart pumps oxygen-poor blood to the lungs and the left side of the heart pumps the oxygenated blood back to the rest of the body. However, in a heart like Finn&rsquo;s, oxygen-poor blood enters the heart but instead of going to the lungs, the blood is pumped back into the body.

Matthew was able to see him in the Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital Neonatal ICU four hours later. The new mom didn&rsquo;t see her son until the next day but was thankful for every positive update she received.</p><p>Finn spent 11 days in the NICU before his open-heart surgery by pediatric cardiothoracic surgeons, Dr. Shillingford and <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-cardiothoracic-surgeon/dr-eric-ceithaml-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Ceithaml, MD.</a></p><p>&ldquo;Surgery is the only option for patients with complex heart defects like Finn&rsquo;s,&rdquo; explained Dr. Shillingford. &ldquo;During the procedure, called an arterial switch, we switch the great vessels and the tiny coronaries to allow oxygen-rich blood to flow back through the body and oxygen-depleted blood to flow to the lungs like a normal heart.&rdquo;</p><p>After surgery, which takes four to five hours, Finn recovered in the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and was discharged home 15 days later.</p><p><strong>New masterpieces</strong></p><p>The two artists said they were in a creative rut before Finn came along, but art has given them an outlet to express their experience and help other families with similar stories.</p><p>Through the Healing Hearts Project, a Jacksonville nonprofit for that supports and encourages parents of children with CHD, Marissa and Matthew have connected with parents with similar experiences and Finn has met friends with special hearts. They are forever grateful for Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital for connecting them with the program.</p><p>&ldquo;This experience opened a new door for us, both literally and artistically,&rdquo; said Matthew. &ldquo;We now create art inspired by children with hearts like Finn&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a way to let other parents know they aren&rsquo;t alone.&rdquo;</p><p>Today, Finn is a happy, normal 1-year-old who loves flipping pages in books and playing with his toy cars. He still sees Dr. Lacey every nine months. A lot of parents ask Marissa and Matthew if going back to the hospital is scary for them, but they don&rsquo;t think so at all. &ldquo;When we walk back into Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, we feel completely at peace,&rdquo; said the parents. &ldquo;We feel like we&rsquo;re home with family because of how well they cared for our fearless Finn.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Little hearts need big expertise.

Her professors in medical school at the University of Florida College of Medicine constantly stressed the importance of preventive care and having a personal doctor versus going to the ER or urgent care.</p><p>Now as a family physician at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a>&rsquo;s Neptune Beach office, she encourages &ldquo;millennials&rdquo; like herself to get established with a primary care physician.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/c_scale,w_300/v1550009200/Juice/heather-applewhite-md-8x10.jpg\" alt=\"Applewhite\"></div><p>Dr. Applewhite said, &ldquo;Having a primary care physician gives me peace of mind knowing I&rsquo;m staying on top of my screenings and knowing I&rsquo;m doing what I can to make sure my health is as good as it can be,&rdquo; Dr. Applewhite said. &ldquo;No matter what your age, you need to think about your health throughout your life.&rdquo;</p><p>Statistics show that about 28 percent of U.S. men and 17 percent of women don&rsquo;t have a personal doctor or health care provider, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p>But recent studies have found that millennials &ndash; those born between 1981 and 1996 &ndash; are the U.S. largest generation, numbering 83 million. And they&ndash; are almost twice as likely as any other age groups to not have a primary care provider. Consider that a July national poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 45 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds had no primary care provider, compared with 28 percent of adults ages 30 to 49, 18 percent of adults between 50 and 64, and 12 percent ages 65 and older.</p><p>&ldquo;There appears to be a trend in general among people in their 20s and 30s to brush off their health. But that is actually the perfect time to start thinking about your health, as well as risk factors that may run in your family,&rdquo; Dr. Applewhite said.</p><p>Take control of your health earlier rather than later she added, and before your 40s when there is a need for a number of additional screenings.</p><p>Good access to primary care results in more timely care, better preventive care, avoiding unnecessary care, improved costs and lower mortality, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.</p><p>&ldquo;To me, the biggest advantage to having a primary care physician is establishing a relationship with someone who you feel you can be open and honest with and they can be open and honest with you and give you the best advice about your care,&rdquo; Dr. Applewhite said.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3 more benefits to having a primary care physician</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Knowing your history</strong>. Primary care physicians see you on at least an annual basis, know your medical history, and can help you meet your wellness goals. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not seeing the same provider, in some cases serious conditions may be missed because you don&rsquo;t have the continuity of someone looking at the frequency of your symptoms and your whole history,&rdquo; Dr. Applewhite said. &ldquo;You could end up with more serious problems and complications in the long run.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Providing preventive care and health assessments</strong>. A primary care physician can help you maintain your health and monitor your health over time. They provide you with up-to-date information and screenings, catch potential health issues early on, and help prevent more serious issues from occurring that could require an emergency room visit. Annual screenings assess your health risks and family history for conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. Health assessments also look at your diet, smoking habits and alcohol intake, as well as sexual health risks and emotional and psychological stressors, to name a few.</li><li><strong>Timely referral to specialists.</strong> Primary care physicians have relationships with specialists and can get patients into a specialist in a timely manner and ones who are highly recommended</li></ol><p>When it comes to selecting a primary care physician, Dr. Applewhite suggests checking with your insurance to see which primary care physicians are in-network to ensure the best cost savings. You may also want to look at the provider&rsquo;s background and profile, which may provide insight into their character, interests and experience.</p><p><em>With more than 50 offices, Baptist Primary Care has Northeast Florida&#39;s largest network of primary care doctors dedicated to helping you stay healthy.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Bob DeBoer, and his wife, Barbara, moved to Florida six years ago to be closer to their grandchildren.</p><p>It definitely wasn&rsquo;t to be closer to the sun.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had problems with my skin for years so I don&rsquo;t go sunbathing,&rdquo; said DeBoer, a retired dentist from Milwaukee who now lives in Vilano Beach. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how many benign skin lesions I&rsquo;ve had removed. I have to see a dermatologist twice a year.&rdquo;</p><p>Skin cancer runs in DeBoer&rsquo;s family. Several of his close relatives, including two brothers, have had melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer.</p><p>So when he noticed a suspicious spot on his elbow in August 2017, he immediately told his doctor about it.</p><p>&ldquo;He took a biopsy and put a rush on the results,&rdquo; DeBoer, 68, recalled. &ldquo;Three days later, he called back and told me I had melanoma and I needed to see a surgeon and an oncologist right away. He advised me to call <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center&nbsp;</a>and make an appointment.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/surgical-oncologist/dr-christopher-pezzi-md\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Pezzi, MD</a>, head of surgical Oncology at Baptist MD Anderson, surgically removed three cancerous growths on DeBoer&rsquo;s elbow. Dr. Pezzi also removed DeBoer&rsquo;s sentinel lymph nodes and had them analyzed to make sure the cancer had not spread.</p><p>&ldquo;He had a relatively serious malignant melanoma, but fortunately the lymph nodes were negative for cancer,&rdquo; said Dr. Pezzi, who specializes in breast, endocrine and melanoma surgery. &ldquo;Bob didn&rsquo;t need any more treatment but needs to be watched closely for risk of recurrence.&rdquo;</p><p>It just so happened that on the same day DeBoer was discussing his biopsy results with Dr. Pezzi, Barbara DeBoer, 67, was in St. Augustine finding out the results of a biopsy for breast cancer.</p><p>&ldquo;As I was sitting there, I got a text from Barb that said, &lsquo;Not good news,&rsquo;&rdquo; DeBoer recalled. &ldquo;Dr. Pezzi said, &lsquo;Is there a problem?&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;Yes. My wife just got diagnosed with breast cancer.&rsquo; And he said, &lsquo;I want to see her in my office tomorrow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The DeBoers were planning to take a trip to Vietnam that week, but Barbara&rsquo;s cancer treatment couldn&rsquo;t wait. Besides being diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer known as HER 2 positive, Barbara was simultaneously diagnosed with a form of non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma that affects white blood cells.</p><p>&ldquo;As the saying goes, &lsquo;It takes a village&rsquo; to properly treat someone with such a serious complex breast cancer, or in Barbara&rsquo;s case, two different cancers at the same time,&rdquo; said Dr. Pezzi. &ldquo;This required a team approach and a full year of targeted chemotherapy treatments in our BMDA Infusion Center, followed by radiation and reconstructive breast surgery. She is doing well, with no evidence of breast cancer at this time.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1549916709/Juice/IMG_20190202_0206474_rewind.jpg\" alt=\"CoupleCancer\"></div><p>In January, the DeBoers flew to Southeast Asia for a long-awaited vacation. This summer, they are planning a family reunion in the Dominican Republic to celebrate their 49th wedding anniversary.</p><p>High school sweethearts in their home state of Montana, the couple deliver Meals on Wheels to homebound elders every Thursday in St. Augustine. Bob also volunteers one day a week at the Penney Retirement Community in Green Cove Springs, where he builds hand-cranked mobility carts for a faith-based nonprofit.</p><p>&ldquo;The cancer experiences we&rsquo;ve had are a testimony to our faith in God and a testimony to the treatments we received at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just Dr. Pezzi, it&rsquo;s the whole team at the cancer center.&rdquo;</p><p>Added Dr. Pezzi: &ldquo;We treat people like Bob and Barbara every day and it&rsquo;s great to see them traveling again. Cancer was a big bump in their road, but they have the potential to live long and normal lives for many years to come.&rdquo;</p><p><em>For more information or to schedule an appointment with a cancer specialist, call 1.844.MDA.BAPTIST (1.844.632.2278).

Studies show when people suffer from high workplace stress, they are less engaged, less productive, and absent more often.</p><p>Iverson suggests eight tips to bring a stressful workday back into balance:</p><ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\"><li><strong>Take a pause</strong>. Find a quiet area. Sit in a comfortable position, close your eyes and empty your mind.</li><li><strong>Create visual order</strong>. Pick one horizontal surface in your workspace&mdash;a shelf, table or desk&mdash;and arrange it neatly. Having that one visual cue to in your environment can help you organize your thoughts and keep you calm throughout your day.</li><li><strong>Try a mini meditation</strong>. Check out an app called Headspace&mdash;it can guide you through a meditation in as little time as 10 minutes.</li><li><strong>Look at the view from 2,000 feet</strong>. Take time to think about what you have coming up next week so you&rsquo;re not overwhelmed by it. When you know what&rsquo;s ahead, you become more proactive instead of simply reacting to demands in the moment.</li><li><strong>Schedule breaks throughout the day</strong>. Don&rsquo;t work through lunch or other breaks. People who take some time for themselves are better at work and at home. Don&rsquo;t spend your drive to work dealing with distractions like putting on makeup. Use those few moments to decompress instead.</li><li><strong>Make use of rooms set up for de-stressing</strong>. Some companies have set aside small relaxation rooms where employees can dim the lights, ease into a lounge chair, and soothe themselves with white noise and aromatherapy. A peaceful setting can amplify your normal workday break.</li><li><strong>Create personal space</strong>. Put things in your workplace that make you feel happy or remind you of home. Things like salt rocks, electric candles or family pictures can relax and ground you throughout the day.</li><li><strong>Practice healthy habits</strong>. Eat right, sleep well, and take advantage of opportunities in your workplace to exercise.<br><br><em>It&rsquo;s common for workers to face stress on the job.

But you may not know that only 2 percent of smokers and former smokers get lung cancer screenings.</p><p>Coming from a long line of tobacco farmers, I have seen many family members suffer from chronic lung disease and lung cancer. It&rsquo;s part of what led me to become a pulmonologist. As health care continues to advance, we are seeing more treatment options for lung disease and even more importantly, better ways to detect lung cancer before it&rsquo;s too late.</p><p>Early detection can literally save your life, but only 16 percent of patients are diagnosed at an early stage. If lung cancer is caught at stage 1, the survival rate is close to 90 percent. Cure rates decrease to 40 to 50 percent if detected at stage 2 and go down to 25 percent at stage 3.

Chest X-rays were commonly used, but did not detect small tumors or enlarged lymph nodes, which can be a sign of cancer.</p><p>The solution, recommended by the National Institute of Health, is a low-dose lung cancer CT screening, which is available at all <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/\">Baptist Health&nbsp;</a>hospitals. The screening emits low levels of radiation, is non-invasive and only takes about two minutes to complete. Results are usually available within 24 hours.</p><p>When you consider that lung cancer is the No. 1 killer among all other cancers combined, getting a quick and CT screening makes good sense if you are at high risk of lung cancer.

It&rsquo;s a great opportunity for me to explain how a geriatrician can help older adults enjoy life and stay healthy. Many health issues related to aging can be improved through a holistic approach that geriatricians are trained to provide.</p><p>A geriatrician is a family medicine or internal medicine physician who has completed an additional year of training in geriatrics, the medical specialty that focuses on caring for people 65 and above. We look at the patient&rsquo;s entire health picture and how it affects their ability to age well.</p><p>In addition to medical conditions, there are other factors that play a role in healthy aging, like social support, cognitive health, psychological issues, caregiver support, and many others. A geriatrician is trained to look at all of these factors and works in collaboration with other disciplines to provide a comprehensive care plan and network of support.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Ross\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/c_scale,w_246/v1549401765/Juice/courtney-ross-md-l.jpg\"></div><p>I first became interested in caring for older people in middle school when my grandmother had a rare neurological disorder. I saw the level of medical care she needed and the challenges my mother faced as her primary caregiver juggling a full-time job. I knew then that I wanted to help older adults in some way. I went on to volunteer in nursing homes and assisted living facilities &ndash; playing bingo or helping to serve meals. I was able to connect with patients on a personal level.</p><p>I started my medical career as a primary care doctor, seeing patients age 18 and up, but the majority was over 65. I could see that they needed more attention than the practice could provide. We didn&rsquo;t have the resources or the necessary time to spend with patients -- the average appointment time was about 15 minutes.</p><p>When I learned about <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/geriatric-care\">Baptist&rsquo;s AgeWell Center for Senior Health,</a> I realized that it provided all the components I had missed in primary care. AgeWell has the resources to provide comprehensive care for seniors under one umbrella. We spend 30 minutes or more with patients at each visit.</p><p>Along with providing primary care, our team includes social services, a dedicated pharmacist to address medication questions, a psychologist who understands the unique needs of seniors, and speech and physical therapists. And as part of the Baptist Health system, I can easily make referrals to specialists when needed.</p><p>Baptist Health opened its first AgeWell location on its Jacksonville campus in 2012. It was such a success that Baptist recently opened a second location at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-beaches\">Baptist Medical Center Beaches,</a> where more than half of the hospital&rsquo;s patients are 65 and over.</p><p>I love being a geriatrician in Jacksonville because I get to meet patients from all over the country. I get to hear their stories about what brought them to Florida. Many of our patients are well and active and want to optimize their health as they age.</p><p>Even if you&rsquo;re in good health and you&rsquo;re 65 or older, you may want to consider seeing a geriatrician. We are attuned to subtle health changes and can help you get ahead of common aging issues. You can get a baseline medical assessment without becoming an AgeWell patient. There are also other programs you can take advantage of at our downtown and beaches locations without becoming a patient, including bladder health and memory assessment.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/geriatrician/dr-courtney-ross-md\"><em>Courtney Ross, MD,</em></a><em>&nbsp;is a geriatrician at the AgeWell Center at Baptist Medical Center Beaches.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>The six million dollar bionic man from the 1970s TV series was better, stronger and faster than before. In real life, hip replacement patients, at least in the near term, are thinking more about how to walk, sleep, or go up and down the stairs without damaging their healing joint.</p><p>There&rsquo;s another worry that often goes unspoken: When will it be safe to have sex again?</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard subject. People tend to feel ashamed, or nervous talking about it,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.joionline.net/physicians/bio/brett_p_frykberg_md/\" target=\"_blank\">Brett Frykberg, MD</a>, an orthopedic surgeon with <a href=\"https://www.joionline.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</a>. &ldquo;You can tell they want to ask that question. And so, I bring it up.&rdquo;</p><p>The short answer is that sex is OK as soon as you feel ready. But in the beginning, you should avoid certain positions to protect the joint from stress.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a common misconception that sex is going to be very painful after hip surgery, Dr. Frykberg said. But, the truth is there&rsquo;s actually a lot less pain. Hip surgery is all about improving the quality of life. Sex included.</p><p>People choose hip surgery when a condition, usually arthritis, is causing pain, sometimes so much that it limits movement.</p><p>&ldquo;An arthritic hip is the equivalent of putting a square peg in a round hole,&rdquo; Dr. Frykberg said. &ldquo;The hip doesn&rsquo;t move very well, and it&rsquo;s painful to flex.&rdquo;</p><p>A hip surgery re-creates the round-on-round surface, allowing fluid movement.</p><p>Hip replacement patients need to be careful not to stress the joint, though, while muscles, tendons and ligaments are healing. The most vulnerable period is the first six weeks following surgery, Dr. Frykberg said.</p><p>If the surgical incision was made from the rear, recovering patients must avoid bending at the waist beyond 90 degrees or rotating the leg inward. If the incision was made from the front, they should avoid extending the leg or rotating toes outward.</p><p>The restrictions sound like movements people commonly practice during sex. So, it matters which position is used.</p><p>&ldquo;Men really have no trouble,&rdquo; Dr. Frykberg said. &ldquo;Women, on the other hand, need to worry more.&rdquo;</p><p>One position Dr. Frykberg recommends is the simple missionary position. Another is with both partners standing, the woman bending slightly at the waist and the man approaching from behind. These positions keep the waist bending and leg rotation to a minimum. Pillows can be stacked to help stabilize a good position over a longer period of time.</p><p>The biggest danger following a hip replacement is dislocation&mdash;the ball of the hip joint popping out of the socket. That hardly ever happens. But people should avoid quick, reactive motions that can trigger it, Dr. Frykberg said.</p><p>&ldquo;Just do things slowly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your body is going to let you know if you put yourself in a wrong position. If you go slowly, you can reverse it. Pain will be your indicator.&rdquo;</p><p><em>For more information about hip replacement, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.joionline.net/centers-of-expertise/hip/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Jacksonville Orthopedic Institute</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>",

The series, based off of her best-selling books, has become an internet phenomenon since its release earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve missed your friend&rsquo;s posts on social media of perfectly organized closets and trash bags full of items to donate, here&rsquo;s the gist &hellip;</p><p>Using her very own method of organizing, Kondo visits various American family homes full of clutter and leads people to tidying up their houses.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable fr-fil\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/c_scale,h_710/v1548885944/Juice/MarieKondo.jpg\" alt=\"MarieKondo\" style=\"width: 300px;\"></div><p>&ldquo;Keep only those things that speak to the heart, and discard items that no longer spark joy. Thank them for their service &mdash; then let them go,&rdquo; writes Kondo on her website.</p><p>Kondo&rsquo;s claim? Tidying up your house can have a positive psychological impact on your life. Vivian Pinner, MEd, a licensed mental health counselor at <a href=\"http://baptistbehavioralhealth.com\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>, confirms that&rsquo;s true but says it&rsquo;s not quite that simple.</p><p>Decluttering doesn&rsquo;t just apply to &ldquo;things.&rdquo; Getting rid of toxic relationships, stressful debt and negative thoughts are all part of the transformation to leading a happier life.</p><p><strong>&lsquo;Start with the mind, not the closet&rsquo;</strong></p><p>&ldquo;We have to be intentional about <em>why</em> we are decluttering in order to make a long-term change,&rdquo; said Pinner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a whole-life approach that starts with the mind, not the closet.&rdquo;</p><p>Decluttering is a great way to start gaining control over things in our lives that cause negative psychological and physical energy. We<em>&nbsp;can&nbsp;</em>control our environment, our thoughts, our relationships and our fitness. We only have to start with one.</p><p>Ask yourself: &ldquo;Is this helping me reach my goals or deterring me from forward progress?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>A society of excess</strong></p><p>Kondo, the Japanese organizational guru, makes us wonder, &ldquo;How did we get here in the first place?&rdquo;</p><p>There are three primary influences.</p><ol><li><strong>Fear.</strong> &ldquo;The main reason we hold onto things is fear,&rdquo; said Pinner. &ldquo;With sentimental items, people feel they may forget special memories of loved ones if they get rid of them. That&rsquo;s just not true.&rdquo; Memories are stored in the brain, not the storage bin. We&rsquo;re not saying donate all sentimental items but like Kondo reminds us, we should be asking ourselves, &ldquo;Does it spark joy?&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Endowment effect.</strong> Research confirms we irrationally ascribe a higher value to something simply because we own it. In 1990, two social scientists teamed up for a clever experiment at Cornell University. They gave coffee cups to half of the students in a group and nothing to the other half. The study showed that people left empty-handed would only pay $2.25-$2.75 for a mug, but those with coffee cups in hand wouldn&rsquo;t accept less than $5.25.</li><li><strong>The future.</strong> We keep things because we think we may use them in the future. That ski trip you only take once every 5 years? Don&rsquo;t keep the ski parka.</li></ol><p><strong>Above all, love yourself</strong></p><p>If the latest fad in cleaning doesn&rsquo;t work for you and your family, don&rsquo;t be too hard on yourself. Focus on creating at least one place of peace in your house.</p><p>&ldquo;Love yourself for what you can do and what you can change,&rdquo; reminded Pinner. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t start with your stuff, start with your mind. Tell yourself three great things about who you are each day.&rdquo;</p><p>Forward progress will follow.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Need someone by your side as you tidy up your life?

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Madison Wade enjoys riding horses. She has grown up around horses at her family&rsquo;s Southeast Georgia home and she loves that her gentle and loyal companions represent strength and adventure.</p><p>&ldquo;Riding my horse, Blue, is so much fun,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;For me, it&rsquo;s an adrenalin rush and it gives me a sense of freedom.&rdquo;</p><p>Madison is comfortable in the saddle whether her horse is traveling at a quiet trot or a vigorous gallop. Because the 19-year-old woman rides horses effortlessly, many would never suspect that Madison lives with cystic fibrosis (CF), a chronic lung disease that complicates her life and threatens to block the active lifestyle that she so passionately enjoys.</p><p>&ldquo;Madison is a very tough young woman,&rdquo; said Gail Wade, Madison&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;She rarely misses school, she doesn&rsquo;t give up and she doesn&rsquo;t live her life in a bubble.&rdquo;</p><p>Madison, a South Georgia State College freshman majoring in psychology at and a graduate of Ware County High School, was recently one of 55 children and young adults celebrated at the 10th annual Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Challenge, held Jan. 26, 2019, at The Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville. The family-friendly fundraising event thousands of individuals and teams of runners together to hit the pavement in honor of the tens of thousands of children who are cared for by Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital each year.</p><p>Gail Wade was pregnant with Madison when her daughter was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease passed down through families. Madison&rsquo;s older brother, Brent, also lives with CF, a disease caused by a defective gene that makes the body produce abnormally thick and sticky mucus. The mucus builds up in the breathing passage of the lungs and the pancreas, and results in life-threatening lung infections and serious digestion problems.</p><p>Madison was born 10 weeks premature at a Jacksonville hospital and then transferred to <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.com\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville</a> as a newborn. Until recently, when she transitioned to an adult hospital for care, Madison came to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s every two to three months for check-ups. With treatment and the help of the medical team of specialists at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, Madison has learned how to manage living with CF. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No one knows I have CF unless I tell them,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;CF is something I&rsquo;ve dealt with my entire life.&rdquo;</p><p>When symptoms such as coughing, difficulty breathing or eating, or fatigue would increase, Madison would be admitted to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, which serves children from all over Georgia and Florida, where she received IV antibiotics to treat infections and other therapies to reduce the buildup of mucus in her lungs. While at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, Madison enjoyed participating in art, music and pet therapies. Spending time at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s and receiving play therapy has inspired Madison to pursue a career as a child life specialist.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s always went above and beyond to make me feel as if they had known me forever,&rdquo; Madison said. &ldquo;They treated me just like family.&rdquo;</p><p>Gail Wade is grateful for the special care and attention Madison received at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s was so good to us,&rdquo; Gail said. &ldquo;They always remembered what Madison enjoyed, whether it was horseback riding or sweet tea.&rdquo;</p><p>Gail also appreciates the numerous hospital enhancements, such as the parents&rsquo; lounge that were designed over the years for patient families&rsquo; comfort and convenience.</p><p>&ldquo;Wolfson Children&rsquo;s has been our home away from home for a long time,&rdquo; Gail Wade said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the little things that mean so much when you&rsquo;re there. We are thankful that Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital is only an hour and a half from our home in Waycross.&rdquo;</p><p><em>For information on the lung and respiratory services offered by Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital and its pediatric health care partner, Nemours Children&#39;s Specialty Care, visit <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/lung-and-respiratory\" target=\"_blank\">wolfsonchildrens.com</a>.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Daniel and Kathy Brown were enjoying a Saturday night college football game at a friend&rsquo;s house. They had been watching their three boys &mdash; 4-year-old Noah, 5-year-old Dalton, 6-year-old Dylan &mdash; in the pool, and were helping them get out and dry off.</p><p>As they entered the screened porch, Daniel noticed Noah and Dylan were gone. Since Dylan often took his younger brother to the bathroom, Daniel and Kathy weren&rsquo;t too alarmed. And then Dylan returned, without Noah in tow. His parents headed straight for the pool.</p><p>&ldquo;All I could see was a dark shadow figure at the bottom of the pool &mdash; it was my youngest son. He was at the bottom unconscious,&rdquo; remember Daniel. &ldquo;I dove in and as soon as I opened my eyes he was right there in front of me. He was face down at the bottom. I scooped him up under his arms and pushed off the bottom of the pool. I laid him on the side of the pool, hopped out and immediately started chest compressions.&rdquo;</p><p>Thanks to his years in the Navy, Daniel knew CPR. He remembers his other children looking on from the screened porch.</p><p>&ldquo;My oldest son, I remember him crying and screaming, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not going to make it.&rsquo; It was rough. It was the hardest thing I&rsquo;ve ever had to,&rdquo; Daniel said.</p><p>But soon, Noah began breathing on his own and regaining awareness.911 dispatchers stayed on the phone until the ambulance arrived and Noah was transported to <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>, where he made a full recovery with the help of the ER and Pediatric ICU teams.</p><p>&ldquo;It was like watching an orchestra as they worked together, many times not saying anything but knowing when they needed to help one another,&rdquo; said Robert &ldquo;Ed&rdquo; Brown, Noah&rsquo;s grandfather and director of Production Operations Services for Baptist Health, who was with his family while Noah was being treated.</p><p>&ldquo;When I first got there, they had already done a few tests,&rdquo; said Daniel. &ldquo;They had concerns about his oxygen level so they were monitoring that. While that was going on, my other two sons were still in swim trunks and I was soaking wet, and the staff helped out tremendously. They brought heated blankets, snacks and drinks so my boys could keep warm, and they even brought me a set of scrubs so I could change out of my clothes. They noticed that and took it upon themselves to take care of me and my boys.&rdquo;</p><p>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s is also home to <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/child-advocacy\" target=\"_blank\">THE PLAYERS Center for Child Health</a>, which leads <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/safe-kids-northeast-florida\" target=\"_blank\">Safe Kids Northeast Florida</a>, an advocacy coalition that teaches safety precautions to parents in the community. Safe Kids Northeast Florida promotes many methods of water safety, including parents learning CPR just like Daniel. Another water safety tool is keeping children in year-round swimming lessons.</p><p>&ldquo;Since we live in Florida, where there are so many pools and natural bodies of water, as well as warm weather for much of the year, it&#39;s especially important for children to have continuous reinforcement of their swimming skills to keep them safe,&rdquo; said Cynthia Dennis, RN, coordinator of Safe Kids Northeast Florida.</p><p>In addition, experts on child safety say the time passing between seasonal swimming lessons can even cause children&rsquo;s swimming skills to regress, meaning they must refresh those skills before they can build new ones.</p><p>For preschooler Noah, his harrowing experience hasn&rsquo;t changed a thing about him. But it certainly has made his parents even more passionate about water safety than ever before.</p><p>&ldquo;He still runs up to water like he has no fear. He&rsquo;s not scared at all. He&rsquo;s our little wild child!&rdquo; said Daniel. &ldquo;Because of Noah, I&rsquo;m going to be doing some volunteer work just to share my story, and hopefully grab the attention of people before a CPR class start and tell them how it could save the life of someone close to them.&rdquo;</p><p>Brown says he tries not to envision his son&rsquo;s shadowy figure in the pool, but sometimes he can&rsquo;t help it. He is now volunteering with Safe Kids Northeast Florida to promote water safety and tell Noah&rsquo;s story in CPR classes, turning his own negative memories into positive actions.</p><p>Year-round lessons in Northeast Florida are available at the following locations:</p><ul><li><strong>Aqua Swim Schools</strong><br>904.775.9400, aquaswimclub.com</li><li><strong>Splash Jax Swim School</strong><br>904.608.4775</li><li><strong>Swimming Safari</strong><br>.904260.1836, swimmingsafari.com</li><li><strong>Swim Lesson Club USA</strong><br>833.794.6777, swimlessonclubusa.com</li><li><strong>YMCA</strong></li></ul><p>Visit <a href=\"https://fcymca.org/\" target=\"_blank\">fcymca.org </a>for each location&rsquo;s contact information and whether they offer year-round swim lessons.</p><p><em>To sign up for a Family and Friends CPR Class, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/patient-info/classes-and-events/family-and-friends-cpr-class\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>A few weeks before Christmas, St. Augustine resident Alexandra Naspolini was enjoying a cup of coffee when she heard a neighbor&rsquo;s dog barking frantically at her back door.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone in the neighborhood has a dog so I didn&rsquo;t know whose it was at first,&rdquo; said Naspolini, who lives across the street from Maureen Hatcher and her Labrador retrievers named Bella and Sadie. &ldquo;When I realized the dog was Bella, I tried to comfort her with some toys and treats. But she was so unsettled, I knew something wasn&rsquo;t right and grabbed a leash.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>An alarming discovery</strong></p><p>When Naspolini stepped out of her house, she saw Sadie standing by Hatcher&rsquo;s open front door, barking loudly. Naspolini ran across the street and entered Hatcher&rsquo;s home, where she discovered her neighbor lying unresponsive on her bed.</p><p>Hatcher, 62, was showing clear signs of a stroke: confusion, weakness on one side of the body, and trouble speaking. Naspolini called 911.</p><p>Eleven minutes later, St. Johns County Fire Rescue arrived and transported Hatcher to <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>, home to one of only seven certified Comprehensive Stroke Centers in Florida.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/c_scale,w_747/v1548700628/Juice/amin-nima-aghaebrahim-md-lab-coat-8x10.jpg\" alt=\"Nima\"></div><p>&ldquo;Ms. Hatcher was having an ischemic stroke, caused by a blood clot blocking a vessel that supplies blood, and thus oxygen, to the right side of her brain,&rdquo; explained <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/interventional-neurologist/dr-amin-aghaebrahim-md\" target=\"_blank\">Nima Amim Aghaebrahim</a>, MD, an interventional neurologist with Baptist&rsquo;s Comprehensive Stroke Center. &ldquo;When the brain is deprived of blood, cells die and permanent brain injury can occur. Timing is everything. One of the most important factors that can lead to a good outcome for patients in these situations is to get the blood vessel opened quickly and successfully.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>When she arrived at Baptist Jacksonville, Hatcher was whisked away to the Neurovascular OR for an emergency surgical procedure to unblock the brain vessel.</p><p>Dr. Nima used a special device called a stent retriever to remove the clot by making a small incision in the groin and then passing a microcatheter into the blocked vessel. The minimally invasive procedure, called an endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), took only 20 minutes. Just hours after the procedure, Hatcher was already Facetiming with her family. Three days later, she was discharged after regaining all strength on her left side.</p><p>The first thing Hatcher did when she got home was walk across the street to thank her neighbor. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe it when I saw how well she was doing,&rdquo; said Naspolini. &ldquo;The last time I saw her, she was on a stretcher being loaded into an ambulance.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Groundbreaking research</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint exactly when Hatcher&rsquo;s stroke occurred because no one else was home at the time. She awoke at 7 am feeling ill and collapsed in the bathroom around 11 am, but Bella didn&rsquo;t arrive at Naspolini&rsquo;s back door until around 2 pm. By then, seven hours had elapsed.</p><p>In years past, it was unknown whether acute ischemic stroke patients like Hatcher would benefit from EVT if six or more hours had passed since the onset of stroke symptoms as brain cell death can happen rapidly in some patients.</p><p>But a groundbreaking study known as the DAWN trial showed that certain stroke patients would benefit from the emergency surgical procedure, even six hours after the brain attack and in some case, up to 24 hours. And the trial showed that those same patients had fewer disabilities and an increased ability to carry out daily activities after 90 days.</p><p>&ldquo;The DAWN clinical trial is revolutionary because it truly impacted the way stroke patients are treated,&rdquo; said Dr. Nima, who was recently recognized with the 2018 &ldquo;Young Investigator Award&rdquo; by the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology for his research with a subgroup of the DAWN trial.</p><p>&ldquo;Because of this research, we now know that patients can benefit significantly from intervention outside of a six-hour window, like in Hatcher&rsquo;s case, and even up to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Hatcher is forever grateful to her Stroke Center team and her neighbor, but she also owes her life to her beloved dogs. Little did she know when she rescued Sadie, a black Labrador retriever, in 2013, Sadie (and her best pal Bella) would someday rescue her.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be here today without my two furry, four-legged heroes,&rdquo; said Hatcher. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t live without them.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>BE FAST</strong> and CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY if you observe any sign of a stroke.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>As much as we love to celebrate the holidays, too much excitement can spell trouble for those managing chronic conditions like heart disease. How can you manage travel schedules, family gatherings and the holiday rush while still protecting your health?</p><p>First, realize that holiday parties can bring both joy and stress. In stressful situations, whether it&rsquo;s rushing to &ldquo;get the house ready,&rdquo; or facing a personal conflict with someone you haven&rsquo;t seen in a while, your body&rsquo;s reaction can damage your heart.</p><p>Stress makes your heart race, your muscles tense, and causes a flood of chemicals to rush into your blood stream. Stress is considered a risk factor for heart disease &mdash; much like high blood pressure. You can treat high blood pressure with medication, diet and exercise, but the best way to combat stress is through relaxation.</p><p>Just as your body reacts to stress, it also responds to relaxation. Finding harmony between these two responses can help you find a healthy balance, and keep the joy in your holidays.</p><p><strong>Is this stress real?</strong></p><p>&ldquo;We do see an increase in heart attacks and chest pain symptoms during the holiday season,&rdquo; says Mona Shah, MD, a cardiologist who is one of only two specialists in Florida certified in holistic medicine along with cardiology. &nbsp;&ldquo;On average, there are 33 percent more deaths from heart attacks in December through February than other times of the year.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Dr. Shah, the top three dates for dates for heart attacks are December 25, December 26 and January 1.</p><p>Stress isn&rsquo;t the only culprit, of course. Overindulgence, including too much eating and drinking and not enough exercise, can add to the pressures on your heart.</p><p>Cold weather also can increase your blood pressure and heart rate, and make your heart work harder.</p><p>&ldquo;An important point is that people don&rsquo;t go get help immediately because they are busy with family and friends,&rdquo; Dr. Shah says. &ldquo;Who wants to go to the hospital on Christmas?&rdquo;</p><p>To relieve stress, manage expectations and enjoy a healthy holiday, follow these three simple tips:</p><p><strong>1) Meaning:</strong> When you start to feel overwhelmed, hit the pause button and take a moment to reflect on what matters most: Being with family and friends, sharing your love and caring for one another. Remember, meaningful time together doesn&rsquo;t have to be picture-perfect.</p><p><strong>2) Breathing:</strong> Take a few minutes to do some simple breathing exercises, and let go of unrealistic expectations. Have an affirmation you can repeat, such as &ldquo;I am where I need to be, and everything will work out.&rdquo; Use this technique when your patience is tested, whether it&rsquo;s standing in a long line or having your plans suddenly changed.</p><p><strong>3) Staying on track:</strong> It&rsquo;s fun to step out of your diet sometimes, and holidays are usually a season when people do this. If you overindulge one or two days, go back to eating clean and exercising even for a little bit on the other days. Avoid turning one or two indulgent days of eating into a week or two of gaining.</p><p><strong>When to go to the ER</strong></p><p>Seek urgent care or call 911 if you feel any sort of chest discomfort or pressure, arm discomfort, or jaw pain especially when moving around and engaged in an activity. Call your doctor or visit the ER if you experience shortness of breath, a fluttering sensation in your heart, or are just not feeling yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;Often, I&rsquo;ll see patients during the holidays who have heartburn-like symptoms,&rdquo; Dr. Shah adds. &ldquo;Some patients will chalk up this discomfort to poor eating habits when it&rsquo;s actually a heart condition.&rdquo;</p><p>Remember this: Any change in symptoms or new symptoms should prompt a phone call or a trip to the emergency room. Take care of yourself first and be diligent about your health even, and especially, during the holidays, so you can be around to enjoy the next one. If you or a loved one is in distress this holiday season, call <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>&#39;s 24-hour crisis line at 904.202.7900.</p>",

More importantly, long-term success depends on the patient&rsquo;s ability to make permanent lifestyle changes.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/c_scale,w_747/v1543962572/Juice/michelle-pendleton-8x10.jpg\" alt=\"Pendleton\"></div><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t wake up one morning and say, &lsquo;I want bariatric surgery.&rsquo; It doesn&rsquo;t work like that. You have to decide if you can alter your lifestyle,&rdquo; said Michelle Pendleton, ARNP, a nurse practitioner with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care&nbsp;</a>in St. Marys, Ga., who specializes in women&rsquo;s health, pediatrics, obesity and bariatrics. &ldquo;There are highs and lows. It&rsquo;s not a quick fix.&rdquo;</p><p>Pendleton should know. She had gastric bypass surgery five years ago while working as a hospital charge nurse. At the time, she was also diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder whose exact cause is unknown but when treated and combined with weight loss, reduces the risk of long-term conditions such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.</p><p>&ldquo;I was very overweight, my blood pressure was sky high and I was having chest pains,&rdquo; recalled the 39-year-old Pendleton. &ldquo;I was too young for all of that. My primary doctor thought I would be a good candidate for bariatric surgery. He said it would probably fix the health problems I was having. But from day one, I was against it.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Life-altering procedure</strong></p><p>A Jacksonville native, Pendleton said she was &ldquo;always heavy&rdquo; growing up. She had tried a slew of diets, losing anywhere between 30 and 50 pounds at a time, but always gaining the weight right back.</p><p>&ldquo;I tried time and time again to lose weight. Everything from Weight Watchers&reg; to medically supervised diets, until I finally decided to have <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/bariatric-surgery/weight-loss-surgery-options\" target=\"_blank\">gastric bypass surgery</a>,&rdquo; she explained.</p><p>Gastric bypass surgery is a lot like what it sounds. A surgeon creates a small pouch by dividing the stomach and then connects the bottom end of the surgically divided small intestine to the newly created stomach pouch. The new rerouting of the food stream suppresses hunger.</p><p>Since her surgery in 2012, Pendleton has maintained a 120-pound weight loss. Her PCOS also went away. &ldquo;But I have to pay attention to what I&rsquo;m eating all the time,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;If I eat the wrong thing, I will get sick. There are consequences.&rdquo;</p><p>When patients in her family medicine practice inquire about bariatric surgery, Pendleton, who competes in running events like the Disney Princess 10K at Walt Disney World, gives them more than just her educated opinion. &ldquo;I tell them it&rsquo;s a life-altering procedure,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it was a good decision for me.&rdquo;</p><p><em>The <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/bariatric-surgery\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Center for Bariatrics&nbsp;</a>offers the highest level of quality care through every step of your weight loss journey.

He learned to live with the pain until it became almost unbearable in his 40s.</p><p>&ldquo;My hip would ache and I would get a sharp pain when I planted my foot to play tennis or move around,&rdquo; said the former University of North Florida All-American doubles player. &ldquo;It felt like somebody was stabbing me with a knife in the hip.&rdquo;</p><p>Searching for answers, Witt eventually turned to Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute (JOI) and opted for a unique approach that would allow him to keep more of his own hip bone instead of undergoing a total hip replacement.</p><p>His orthopedic surgeon was <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/orthopedic-surgeon/dr-brett-frykberg-md\">Brett Frykberg, MD,&nbsp;</a>an acknowledge expert in the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing System, which restores the natural shape of the joint and provides better stability, longevity and higher levels of patient activity than a traditional hip replacement.</p><p>As part of the procedure, only the surface of the femoral head (ball) is shaved off. A cap is then put on the top of the hip, similar to capping a tooth, instead of replacing the entire head and neck of the femoral bone.</p><p>Dr. Frykberg, who performed the procedure in New York before coming to JOI and <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health</a> in 2014, also trained in England with the inventor of the resurfacing system, Dr. Derek McMinn.</p><p>Dr. Frykberg has performed about 100 of these resurfacings and is one of a small number of surgeons in the state doing the procedure, according to Smith &amp; Nephew, Inc., which manufactures the products used in the resurfacing. According to Dr. Frykberg, hip resurfacing presents no physical restrictions to the patient.</p><p>&ldquo;Once recovered, people can return to normal activities such as running, biking, swimming, hockey and baseball. Resurfacing allows that high level of activity, which total hip replacement does not do,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;You keep most of your own bone and your range of motion is better.&rdquo;</p><p>The JOI procedure is suited for men between the ages of 20 and 60 for whom total hip replacement may not be appropriate due to their level of physical activity.</p><p>Active men who suffer from hip pain due to non-inflammatory arthritis (degenerative joint disease), such as osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, avascular necrosis, or dysplasia/DDH, or inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, may be good candidates.</p><p>&ldquo;The procedure is not good for women,&rdquo; Dr. Frykberg said, &ldquo;because women have smaller femoral neck bones, which are more brittle and not strong enough to hold the implant.&rdquo;</p><p>Witt, who has developed competitive junior tennis players for more than 20 years, and has served as a coach for USTA Team Florida, is now able to run and play tennis again without pain.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been great,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Outside of my job, I still like to stay fit and work out a lot. Even when I&rsquo;m on the tennis court, I can move around better now. It&rsquo;s just awesome.&rdquo;</p><p><em>For more information on the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing System or other hip and knee procedures at Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute, go to</em><a href=\"http://www.joionline.net/\"><em>&nbsp;joionline.net</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

But too often, they leave out one big lifestyle change.</p><p>That college &ldquo;frenemy,&rdquo; that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been a long day&rdquo; pal: alcohol.</p><p>About 70 percent of Americans do not recognize drinking alcohol as a risk factor for cancer, according to the National Cancer Opinion Survey. But now, for the first time, the American Society of Clinical Oncology has linked alcohol use &mdash; light, moderate or heavy &mdash; with increased risk for several leading cancers, including those of the breast, colon, esophagus, and head and neck.</p><p>The Society reported that 5.5 percent of all new cancers and 5.8 percent of all cancer deaths worldwide can be attributed to alcohol.</p><p>&ldquo;I think people often underestimate the amount they are drinking,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/hematologist-oncologist/dr-amanda-shreders-md\" target=\"_blank\">Amanda Shreders, MD</a>, a hematologist/oncologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center.</a> &ldquo;This announcement may bring alcohol into more conversations, and maybe having this awareness will inspire people to be more informed about what they put in their bodies.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, to be absolutely safe, the recommendation would be to stop drinking entirely, Dr. Shreders said. But the oncologists aren&rsquo;t saying that. Instead, the group suggests that if you want to lower your cancer risk, reduce your alcohol intake.</p><p>Drinking, which affects all races, ages and income levels, is on the rise in the United States, and binge drinking has become the most common, deadly pattern of excessive alcohol abuse, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>In fact, one in six adults binge drinks about four times a month, consuming about eight drinks per binge.</p><p>Dr. Shreders said that when she asks patients about their drinking, they often tell her, &ldquo;Oh, I just drink socially.&rdquo; But she struggles to quantify such a statement.</p><p>&ldquo;I think this report helps highlight what exactly that means,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;We need to make it so that physicians are not afraid to ask how much alcohol a patient drinks, and patients shouldn&rsquo;t be intimidated by the question. We want to make sure we get the best care possible for our patients.&rdquo;</p><p>People tend to think alcohol is only linked to liver cancer, Dr. Shreders said, but those who drink moderately &mdash; one drink daily for women and two for men &mdash; nearly double their risk for mouth and throat cancer compared to nondrinkers. For women, just one alcoholic drink a day can increase breast cancer risk.</p><p>Women concerned about their risk might consider further lowering their alcohol intake to three or four drinks a week. Red wine should not be considered an exception. There is no clear evidence that drinking red wine helps the body, according to the clinical oncologist society.</p><p>Heavy drinkers, who consume more than seven drinks a week for women or more than 14 a week for men, see their risk increase dramatically. For throat and mouth cancers, the risk is more than five times higher for heavy drinkers than it is for nondrinkers. Heavy drinkers also see double the risk of liver cancer than nondrinkers.</p><p>Research is still being developed to determine whether or not those who stop drinking see benefits from the lifestyle change. However, Dr. Shreders said analysis indicates former drinkers do see a decline in their risk, particularly for head and neck cancers.</p><p>The relationship between cancer and alcohol appears to be dose dependent, which means risk increases as consumption increases, she added.</p><p>&ldquo;The first step is people need to be aware of how much they are actually drinking,&rdquo; Dr. Shreders said. &ldquo;A primary care doctor is a great resource &mdash; to connect you with resources in the community, to help you understand heavy alcohol use.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Have a primary care doctor?

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends scrubbing for at least 20 seconds &ndash; the equivalent of singing the &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; song from beginning to end twice.</p><p>In Almeria, Spain, researchers studied 911 children younger than age three from 24 daycare centers. One group used hand sanitizer to clean hands, one group used soap and water, and the control group followed its usual hand-washing routines.</p><p>After the eight-month study period, data revealed the hand sanitizer group missed 3.25 percent of days in daycare, the soap- and -water group missed 3.9 percent of days, and the control group missed 4.2 percent of days &ndash; suggesting hand sanitizer use cuts back on young children&rsquo;s sick days when compared to hand washing. Interesting? Sure. But <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-heather-applewhite-md\" target=\"_blank\">Heather Applewhite, MD</a>, a family physician with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a>, wants readers to know the truth isn&rsquo;t black and white.</p><p>&ldquo;The study had limitations that can&rsquo;t be ignored,&rdquo; said Dr. Applewhite. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that hand sanitizer can be a convenient option when soap and water aren&rsquo;t available, but hand sanitizer is not always a better choice.&rdquo;</p><p>The study was only done for respiratory illnesses. For common colds, hand sanitizer would be a good option to reduce spreading germs. When it comes to illnesses accompanied by diarrhea or when hands are visibly dirty, soap and water is the right option.</p><p>The study had a narrow and specific patient population with a limited age group and small number of daycare centers. The authors conjectured the reason why hand sanitizer users actually had fewer missed days of school was compliance. It&rsquo;s easier for energetic children under the age of 3 to use hand sanitizer frequently and correctly than the full, detailed soap-and-water routine.</p><p>Dr. Applewhite, who washes her hand more than 10 times a day and uses hand sanitizer more than 20 times a day, offered advice based on CDC recommendations for how and when to use each:</p><p>Hand Sanitizer:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Use when soap and water are not available.</li><li>Use hand sanitizers that are at least 60 percent alcohol.</li><li>Apply enough product to hands to cover all surfaces.</li><li>Rub hands together until completely dry (scrubbing for about 20 seconds). Wiping excess hand sanitizer off of hands before it dries reduces effectiveness.</li><li>Hand sanitizer is safe for children of all ages but children should be monitored when applying. Ingesting the product can be dangerous. Dr. Applewhite recommends that parents and caregivers carry hand sanitizer for use until soap and water is available.</li></ul><p>Soap and Water:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Use when hands are visibly dirty, before and after food preparation and consumption, before and after treating a wound or caring for someone who is sick, after touching animals, after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, and after using the bathroom.</li><li>Wet hands with clean, running water.</li><li>Apply soap to hands and rub together, making sure it covers all surfaces. Dr. Applewhite recommends unscented, nonantibacterial soap, especially for those with sensitive skin.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t forget: Wash your hands for as long as it takes to sing the &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; song twice (about 20 seconds).</li><li>Rinse hands under clean, running water.</li><li>Air dry hands or wipe with a clean towel.</li><li>The CDC hand-washing website has a comprehensive list for all times when soap and water should be used.</li></ul><p>Those 20 seconds at the sink can make a big difference in reducing the spread of illnesses, infections, diseases and germs!</p><p>Consult your primary care physician for more information about reducing the spread of germs.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>With travel, presents and parties to attend, it&#39;s easy to overspend during December. While you may feel pressured to visit the whole family and stuff every stocking, the worst gift you can give yourself for the holidays is debt, which will turn into chronic financial stress as you work to pay it off throughout the year.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s how one financial expert suggests tackling holiday spending.</p><p><strong>1. Budget for holiday expenses like you would any other bills.</strong></p><p>The holidays come around every year, so treat them as a recurring expense just like you would a car payment or mortgage.</p><p>&ldquo;When building your household budget, plan to set aside a certain amount each month or paycheck for holiday shopping,&rdquo; said Zachary Benscoter, budget manager for Baptist Health. &ldquo;If you put $20 from each paycheck into your savings account and you&rsquo;re paid 26 times per year, that&rsquo;s $520. Build your budget to see if you&rsquo;ll have enough to cover your expenses, and then decide how much money you&rsquo;d like to try to save.&rdquo;</p><p>If you made the naughty list for not budgeting this year, simply track what you do spend so you can budget appropriately next year.</p><p>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t have a budget this year, determine how much you spent on travel and gifts, and how much you&rsquo;d be comfortable spending next year,&rdquo; said Benscoter. &ldquo;Take that amount and divide it by the total number of paychecks you get per year so you know how much you need to save.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>2. Make a list; check it twice. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Benscoter says he doesn&rsquo;t enter a store without a plan, which can lead to browsing and overbuying.</p><p>&ldquo;I decide who I want to spend money on &mdash; and who I want to spend the most money on &mdash; to determine how much I&rsquo;ll be spending in the holiday season,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Obviously kids in the family may be more expensive. But it starts with setting aside money for each person I want to buy gifts for and sticking to that amount.&rdquo;</p><p>If you decide on specific items to purchase your loved ones rather than setting a price limit, there are still ways to save money.</p><p>&ldquo;Say you&rsquo;re looking for ways to get money back. You can access sites like Ebates, and certain banks offer cash-back rewards you just have to activate online. Log in to your account for a list of various retailers where, if you make a purchase at that retailer with that card, you get a certain percentage back,&rdquo; he said.</p><p><strong>3. If you didn&rsquo;t budget, don&rsquo;t go into debt.</strong></p><p>While the holidays feel like the time to give, give, give, don&rsquo;t allow gifting or travel costs to send you into debt.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re looking for cash around Christmas, one thing you can do is look around your house for items you don&rsquo;t really use anymore,&rdquo; said Benscoter. &ldquo;There are a lot of online resale apps and marketplaces, like on Facebook or OfferUp, which let you sell your things online. This is finding money versus going into debt.&rdquo;</p><p>His biggest piece of advice: be honest with those around you. Most people feel financial stress at this time of year, and by agreeing to no gifts, you may grant everyone some peace of mind.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no shame in not buying Christmas gifts for people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth going into debt or taking on a financial burden if you can&rsquo;t afford it, and there&rsquo;s no shame in that because, most likely, everyone has been there at some point.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If the holidays are a source of distress for you, consider using&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/mental-health/10-ways-to-manage-your-anxiety\" target=\"_blank\"><em>physician-recommended anxiety management techniques</em></a><em>&nbsp;to minimize stress.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, it&rsquo;s hard to feel like yourself when you&rsquo;re sleeping in a hotel bed, riding in the back of cabs and eating out for every meal. From business trips to holiday travel, we&rsquo;re always on the go. And it&rsquo;s even harder to travel when you&rsquo;re sick. Tips from <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-stacy-quinn-do\" target=\"_blank\">Stacy Quinn, DO</a>, a family physician with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a>, has tips for every situation to help you stay healthy while traveling.</p><p><strong>In your suitcase:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Before you pack your bags to head out of town, thoughtfully think about how to fill your suitcase with items that will make staying healthy a breeze. Stuff your suitcase with Dr. Quinn&rsquo;s recommendations:</p><ul><li><strong>Comfortable shoes.</strong> &ldquo;When I travel, I usually end up exploring on foot,&rdquo; said Dr. Quinn. &ldquo;Blisters from new shoes and uncomfortable attire make the vacation a lot less fun.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Sunscreen.&nbsp;</strong>Dermatologists recommend wearing sunscreen daily no matter the season, but it&rsquo;s an essential item to pack for a trip to the tropics.</li><li><strong>Insect repellant.</strong> This is a very important tool for avoiding insect-borne diseases, as well as painful insect bites.</li><li><strong>List of physicians and phone numbers.</strong></li><li><strong>One-page medical history.</strong></li><li><strong>Your insurance card or a photo copy of it.</strong></li><li><strong>Medication with doses.</strong> For patients who are concerned about packing prescriptions, Dr. Quinn offers to write a note explaining the patient&rsquo;s medical needs and medications.</li><li><strong>Prescriptions and other medications.&nbsp;</strong>Airlines recommend that passengers keep prescription medications in their carry-on luggage to make sure they have it handy if they need it. It&rsquo;s very common for Dr. Quinn to be asked &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; for her patients with prescription medicines who are nervous about traveling. Her key advice:</li></ul><ol><li>Make sure you have enough medicine so you don&rsquo;t have to get a refill when you are out of town.</li><li>Take a pill box. It&rsquo;s helpful to have medicines organized by day and then you only have to pack the amount you will need for the trip.</li><li>If you&rsquo;re flying and medicine needs to be refrigerated, just pack a small cooler.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>On the plane:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If you have anxiety about flying, talk to your physician about it,&rdquo; said Dr. Quinn. &ldquo;I recommend deep breathing during takeoff and landing, selecting an aisle seat to have more space, and a fun distraction like calming music or a great book.&rdquo;</p><p><u>What to bring:</u></p><ul><li><strong>Wipes.</strong> These are helpful to sanitize the tray table, seat and surrounding area.</li><li><strong>Hand sanitizer.&nbsp;</strong>Remember to pack a small bottle if you&rsquo;re flying &ndash; TSA rules say any liquid must be less than 3.4 ounces! It&rsquo;s important to wash your hands with soap and water frequently, but hand sanitizer can help kill germs when you don&rsquo;t have access to a sink.</li><li><strong>Calming music or a good book.</strong></li><li><strong>Compression socks.&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Foot and ankle swelling can be normal during air travel,&rdquo; said Dr. Quinn. &ldquo;However, compression socks can help blood flow. You should also elevate your feet and stay hydrated.&rdquo;</li></ul><p><u>Things to do:</u></p><ul><li><strong>Drink lots of water.</strong> Staying hydrated is an important part of keeping your immune system strong.</li><li><strong>Book the aisle seat if possible.</strong></li><li><strong>Stretch your legs.</strong></li><li><strong>Walk around.</strong> &ldquo;Each time you shift your position is a good reminder it&rsquo;s time to get up and walk around,&rdquo; said Dr. Quinn. When you&rsquo;re crammed into an airplane seat, your body has a harder time pumping blood from your legs back to your heart. Getting up to move around is important for your circulatory system and can help prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), blood clots in deep veins inside the body, usually in the lower leg, thigh, or pelvis.</li><li><strong>Get your flu shot</strong>. Everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). It is recommended that people get vaccinated at least two weeks before travel because it takes two weeks for immunity to develop after vaccination. If you are sick with symptoms of influenza-like illness, you should not travel.</li><li>For international travel, visit the CDC website for additional recommended vaccinations and travel advisories.</li></ul><p><strong>At your hotel:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Planning for a healthy and safe hotel stay starts during the booking process.</p><ul><li>For extra steps in your day, <strong>book a hotel within walking distance</strong> of key attractions or take the stairs instead of the elevator.</li><li><strong>Search for hotels with a gym or pool.</strong></li><li><strong>Prioritize safety.&nbsp;</strong>Make sure the hotel is in a safe area and your hotel door is locked at night. Safety is an important part of overall health.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;A good night&rsquo;s sleep is critical to keeping your immune system strong,&rdquo; said Dr. Quinn. &ldquo;Take time at the hotel to destress and catch some ZZs.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>On your plate:</strong></p><p>Finding healthy food on the go can be challenging. We agree - airport salads don&rsquo;t always sound appetizing. Expert tips for maintaining a normal diet:</p><ul><li>Look for a hotel or restaurant with a <strong>breakfast buffet that offers healthy options.</strong></li><li><strong>Pack your own snacks.</strong> Dr. Quinn&rsquo;s favorite travel snacks are oranges, apples and nuts. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Hit the grocery store</strong>. Not only is this usually healthier than eating out, it&rsquo;s also more affordable.</li><li><strong>Inform the airline of any allergies</strong> you have before you travel.</li><li>Restaurant portion sizes can be larger than what we eat on a day-to-day basis. You can always split a plate or ask the restaurant to bring half of your meal to the table and to box the other half.</li><li>People with unique medical conditions should talk to their physician about how to manage dietary needs while on the go. For example, if you have high blood pressure, Dr. Quinn recommends asking for vegetables without added sauces and eliminating extra salt.</li><li><strong>Most importantly &ndash; don&rsquo;t stress!</strong> Eating for nutrition and pleasure are equally important. A big part of travel is experiencing fresh cuisines and making new memories along the way. Bon appetit!</li></ul><div class=\"u-size4of4\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1545839681/Juice/JUICE-Traveling_Healthy_v03.jpg\" alt=\"PackingTips\"></div><p><em>If you have concerns about staying healthy while traveling, talk to your primary care physician.

And for young families, that can also mean with an infant in tow.</p><p>If a crib isn&rsquo;t waiting for your baby at your holiday destination, parents could be tempted to share a bed instead. It&rsquo;s something the American Academy of Pediatrics and Safe Kids Northeast Florida warn against. Guidelines say that, until one year of age, children should sleep:</p><ol><li>Alone</li><li>On their backs, and</li><li>Near a parent, but in a separate safe sleep environment, like a crib or bassinet.</li></ol><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The reality is that parents do sometimes bed-share with their babies, said Cindy Dennis, RN, with <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/safe-kids-northeast-florida\" target=\"_blank\">Safe Kids Northeast Florida</a>, led by <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/child-advocacy\" target=\"_blank\">THE PLAYERS Center for Child Health&nbsp;</a>at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve asked mothers why, and they&rsquo;ve said it just seems like it would be safe and secure to have their baby with them,&rdquo; Dennis said.</p><p>The practice is especially common among nursing mothers, desperate to soothe their babies and to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep for themselves.</p><p>Beds are not safe places for a sleeping infant. Babies can get tangled in a blanket, suffocate from an adult rolling on top of them, fall off the bed, or get wedged between a bed and headboard or wall.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a 2016 study ranked bed-sharing accidents as one of the top three causes of sleep-related infant deaths.&nbsp;</p><p>There&rsquo;s an easy solution on vacation, said Dennis. Bring a Pack &lsquo;N Play portable bassinet with you. It&rsquo;s designed for safe sleep.</p><p><strong>7 ways to keep your baby safe when sleeping away from home</strong></p><ol><li>Don&rsquo;t use that old crib grandma saved from when you were a baby. They don&rsquo;t meet current safety standards. Extended corner posts, decorative cutouts on headboards, and slats spaced more than 2 3/8 inches apart all present strangulation risks. Drop-sided cribs are no longer considered safe.</li><li>Do place your baby on a firm mattress with well-fitted sheets.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t place loose materials in your baby&rsquo;s sleep space: no blankets, no stuffed animals, and no Christmas presents.</li><li>Do use a sleep sack to keep your baby warm instead of bedding. This is a special zipped garment that looks like a sleeper at the top, but fans out into a closed sack at the bottom, like a tiny wearable sleeping bag.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t let your baby sleep in any product not made for routine sleep, such as a rocker, bouncer, swing, or car seat outside the car. Always read product owner&rsquo;s manual for warnings.</li><li>Do supervise your sleeping baby on long road trips, and stop and take her out of her car seat every few hours.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t let your baby share a bed with another child or a pet. The risks are the same as bed-sharing with a parent.</li></ol><p><em>For more safe sleep tips, visit <a href=\"http://FYI.

When you don&rsquo;t feel well, it can be hard to tell if it&rsquo;s just a cold that will pass or if you&rsquo;re facing a sinus infection.</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), colds are the leading cause for missed days of work and school in the United States. A cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract and can be caused by one of nearly 200 different viruses, with rhinovirus being the most common.</p><p>&ldquo;Common colds usually improve on their own in less than 10 days,&rdquo; said Justin Moy, MD, Otolaryngologist (ENT) with Baptist ENT Specialists. &ldquo;The major difference is that a common cold is viral and a sinus infection is bacterial.&rdquo;</p><p>Lasting anywhere from two to 12 weeks, sinus infections affect nearly 35 million Americans at least once a year.

Because colds are viral, antibiotics, which are for bacterial infections, don&rsquo;t help,&rdquo; said Dr. Moy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK to wait at least 10 to 14 days to see a primary care practitioner with cold symptoms.&rdquo;</p><p><u>Allergies:&nbsp;</u></p><p>According to Dr. Bush, most people with allergies will benefit greatly from just using over-the-counter medicines like Zyrtec&reg;, Allegra&reg; and Claritin&reg;. He also recommends nasal sprays like Flonase&reg; and Nasonex &reg;.</p><p>&ldquo;If a patient is not getting better after using over-the-counter medicines for allergies, he or she should consider seeing an <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/ear-nose-and-throat/allergy-testing-and-treatment\" target=\"_blank\">ENT</a> who can determine the next step to take,&rdquo; said Dr. Bush.</p><p><u>Sinus Infections:</u></p><p>There are two key factors to determine when a cold (a viral infection) has progressed to a sinus infection (a bacterial infection).</p><ol><li>10 days of symptoms that are not improving at all can be a sign of a sinus infection. The likelihood of a bacterial infection in the first few days of a cold is very unlikely.</li><li>&ldquo;Second worsening&rdquo; &ndash; When symptoms start to improve and then get significantly worse again, this can also be a sign of a bacterial infection.</li></ol><p>&ldquo;These are examples of when it is time to see a practitioner,&rdquo; said Dr. Bush. &ldquo;At first, your primary care physician can help by prescribing antibiotics. If you have completed two to three rounds of antibiotics without success, the issue lasts more than three months or you are getting a sinus infection more than four times a year, it&rsquo;s time to see an ear, nose and throat specialist.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Similar symptoms &nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>Scratchy throat? Check.</p><p>Sneezing? Check.</p><p>&nbsp;Pressure? Check.</p><p>With so many similar symptoms, these differentiating factors can help determine whether you are facing a cold, allergies or a sinus infection. <img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1575396212/Juice/ColdVsAllergiesVsSinus_1.jpg\" alt=\"ColdSinusAllergy\">Are cold symptoms affecting your health?

He advises patients to have patience when it comes to the above symptoms in the infographic. &ldquo;Many people think they have a sinus infection after just a few days &ndash; wait it out and don&rsquo;t rush to a diagnosis.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><em>For initial concerns, visit your primary care physician.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>You get two weeks of vacation a year, but your workload stays the same. That means your Zen-like state following that restful stretch in Maui is erased by the mountain of work you face in the weeks following your return. Which leaves you wondering: Is a vacation even a thing anymore?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-alicia-rozycki-phd\" target=\"_blank\">Alicia Rozycki, PhD</a>, a psychologist with Baptist Behavioral Health, said she sees the challenge of returning to a significant workload most often with people who have jobs that entail ongoing projects.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known people who feel stressed about taking time off because they know things will just pile up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But, certainly it&rsquo;s not healthy to be in a position where you never feel like you get a break. The physical body and mind need a period of rest.&rdquo;</p><p>Employers take note: Without rest, the body is stressed. Low stress may escalate into high stress, and can eventually develop into full-blown clinical anxiety or depression, cautioned Dr. Rozycki.</p><p><strong>Getting back into the swing of things without sacrificing post-vacation calm</strong></p><p>The easiest solution is to delegate some of the work, before you leave or after you get back, Dr. Rozycki said. Not everyone has a job where that&rsquo;s possible. Consider whether you are doing anything to contribute to your overworked status.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re the kind of person who struggles with assertiveness, you may be the one who gets many projects assigned to you or who struggles with setting a boundary to limit the number of projects you take on,&rdquo; Dr. Rozycki said.</p><p>After you&rsquo;ve negotiated the best work-life balance you can, here are five ways to bring your remaining larger-than-normal workload back under control:</p><ol><li><strong>Prioritize</strong>. Spend some time looking at the tasks for the week, and separate those that need immediate attention from those that can wait.</li><li><strong>Organize</strong>. When you feel overwhelmed by a huge task, your anxiety level will spike. You don&rsquo;t know how to start, so you don&rsquo;t start anywhere. You procrastinate. Break those large tasks down into smaller steps. Small accomplishments build confidence.</li><li><strong>Shift your mindset</strong>. There&rsquo;s a saying: Don&rsquo;t sweat the small stuff; and it&rsquo;s all small stuff. Remember, your Inbox is always going to be full. There&rsquo;s never going to be a time when all of your emails get answered or when all of your tasks are done. In accepting this fact, it may be easier to keep a relaxed attitude and way of being in your approach to work tasks.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel</strong>. Stick with a work style that has been effective for you in the past. Did you get more done when you had 30 minutes at the beginning of the day to plan and organize your day? Make sure you&rsquo;re still doing that.</li><li><strong>Schedule time for relaxation, eat a healthy diet and exercise</strong>. Even though you&rsquo;re playing catch-up, you&rsquo;ll work more efficiently if you practice healthy body-mind-spirit habits.</li></ol><p><em>If you are seeking a mental health care provider, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Behavioral Health</em></a><em>&nbsp;or call 904.376.3800 to speak with a patient coordinator and find one who is right for you.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Chase Busby is a champion. For nearly half his seven years, Chase has been in the race against cancer. In October, Chase reached the finish line marking the end of his chemotherapy treatments.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Chase is a remarkable boy and has shown so much courage,&rdquo; said Cassie Busby, Chase&rsquo;s mom. &ldquo;He is our superhero and we are so grateful to have reached this milestone with him.&rdquo;</p><p>This past November, Chase returned to <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/cancer\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville</a>, where he has received treatment for the past three years, for the removal of his chemotherapy port, a device implanted under the skin that enables patients to receive treatment. Before it was removed, Chase had no memory of life without it.</p><p>Following his port removal, nearly 100 people attended Chase&rsquo;s No More Chemo and Birthday Celebration at Village Creek Landing in St. Simons Island, Ga. To mark the end of his treatments, Dreams Come True of Jacksonville presented Chase with a &ldquo;Last Chemo&rdquo; trophy, and his first-grade friends at St. Simons Elementary also celebrated with him at school.</p><p>In January, Chase will be part of another race &ndash; the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Challenge. Chase is one of 55 children who will be celebrated at the event. The family-friendly fundraising event brings individuals and teams of runners together to hit the pavement in honor of the tens of thousands of children who are cared for by Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital each year.</p><p><strong>A challenging diagnosis</strong></p><p>In 2015 when he was three, Chase was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which occurs when too many immature white blood cells are produced in the bone marrow and multiply out of control. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, and its cause is unknown.</p><p>Initially, Cassie thought Chase had a stomach virus after he experienced common symptoms on and off for a month. Then things took a serious turn. Cassie was trying to get Chase to eat some cereal when he had a seizure.</p><p>Cassie and her husband, Chris, immediately took Chase to the Emergency Care Center at Southeast Georgia Health System&rsquo;s Brunswick campus, where they were seen by emergency medicine physician Erin Compton, MD. Dr. Compton ordered tests that showed Chase&rsquo;s blood counts were dangerously low and his body was in septic shock. She recommended Chase be taken to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Jacksonville.</p><p>The relationship between Southeast Georgia Health System and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s helped facilitate rapid coordination of care for Chase, who was transferred from Southeast Georgia Health System by Kids Kare ambulance to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Jacksonville. Chase spent three days in Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) where doctors gave him a blood infusion and did further testing.</p><p>&ldquo;At Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, we learned there was a chance Chase had leukemia,&rdquo; said Chris Busby. &ldquo;As a parent, you never think your child will have cancer. It was the scariest moment of our lives.&rdquo;</p><p>The testing continued and it took nine days for doctors to arrive at a diagnosis. Chase had so many necrotic cells in his bone marrow that it was difficult to determine if he had leukemia. This unique situation has only occurred with approximately 20 other children in the U.S. To confirm the diagnosis, doctors had to find viable bone marrow, which they located in his front pelvic area with an MRI.</p><p>&ldquo;It certainly wasn&rsquo;t the news we wanted to hear,&rdquo; Chris Busby said. &ldquo;However, we were relieved to have a diagnosis so Chase could begin treatment.&rdquo;</p><p>Chase&rsquo;s treatment included chemotherapy given through a port and other procedures. It was challenging for Cassie and Chris to see their son go through treatment.</p><p>&ldquo;Through it all, Chase was brave and never afraid,&rdquo; Cassie Busby said. &ldquo;He has been such an inspiration to us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone we met at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital was phenomenal,&rdquo; added Chris Busby. &ldquo;The doctors and nurses were amazing and did everything they could to make Chase feel comfortable.&rdquo;</p><p>After a month of intense chemotherapy, a bone marrow biopsy showed that Chase was in remission, marking the beginning of the maintenance phase of treatment. Chase then continued chemotherapy for three years to help destroy any remaining cancer cells in his body. The Busbys were grateful for a positive prognosis and began a countdown to when Chase would complete his treatments.</p><p>When the maintenance phase of treatment ended in October 2018, Chase had completed more than 1,100 days on chemotherapy, five bone marrow biopsies, 20 spinal taps, 67 IV pushes of chemotherapy, 70 complete blood count tests, and eight different chemotherapy drugs. Chase doesn&rsquo;t require any further treatment, but he will continue to have bloodwork every month for the next year at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;This is our family story and we are so grateful to be on the other side of the journey,&rdquo; Cassie Busby said. &ldquo;Every day is not a given. This experience has been a big test of our faith, but there have been many blessings, too.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Chase to be honored at Wolfson Children&#39;s fundraiser</strong></p><p>Chase will attend the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Challenge with his parents, his sisters, Gracie Jane, 10, and Lily, 8, and supporters of the family&rsquo;s fundraising team. For the past three years, the family&rsquo;s Iron Oaks team has led the event&rsquo;s fundraising. They hope to keep their streak going in 2019. Each year since 2016, Chase has attended the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Challenge, except for 2017 when he was receiving care at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Our local community has been incredibly supportive,&rdquo; Chris Busby said. &ldquo;We appreciate their support for our amazing hospital that serves so many children in our area. Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital saved our son&rsquo;s life. We are so thankful to have Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital within driving distance of our home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Chris and I will always be grateful for Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital,&rdquo; added Cassie Busby. &ldquo;We are grateful we did not have to relocate or split up our family so Chase could receive treatment. We are grateful that our doctors and nurses are some of the best in the Southeast and in the nation. We are grateful for the child life specialists and staff who work so hard to keep hospitalized children&#39;s spirits up. I didn&#39;t realize how important it was to have a good children&#39;s hospital close by until our little boy needed it.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital needs your help to ensure every child continues to receive the world-class care they deserve.

Black women also face elevated risk for stroke and high blood pressure, and one in four over the age of 55 has diabetes, the CDC said.</p><p>Former First Lady Michelle Obama is among GirlTrek&rsquo;s nearly 160,000 registered members.</p><p>&ldquo;When we decided to focus on walking as a form of exercise, the women in my church were onboard right away,&rdquo; said Rashad, who leads a health ministry at New Mount Moriah, where her husband, Sha&rsquo;Reff, is the pastor.</p><p>But Rashad didn&rsquo;t stop there. She introduced GirlTrek to a dozen African Methodist Episcopal churches in the area, and spoke about the topic at the annual A.M.E. Church Conference in Jacksonville. In April, she helped Baptist Health host its first GirlTrek event at Ribault High School.</p><p>&ldquo;We have 13 local churches that are now affiliated with GirlTrek,&rdquo; said Rashad. &ldquo;Not everyone can walk eight miles. Some of our members just walk in their neighborhoods. We encourage all levels of activity. Our motto is &lsquo;No sister left behind.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Family reunion 5K</strong></p><p>Rashad moved to Jacksonville in 1998 after her husband, a retired master chief petty officer, was transferred to Naval Air Station Jacksonville for his final duty assignment. The couple&rsquo;s two sons, Shareff II, 31, and Shakeel, 25, both played football at Episcopal High School and collegiately at the University of Central Florida and the University of North Carolina, respectively.</p><p>Since coming to Baptist in April 1999, Rashad has participated in a number of volunteer endeavors. She served as a Tipping the Scale summer employment mentor from 2014-2016 and has served as treasurer of the annual Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital bass tournament since 2013. She recently became a year-round Tipping the Scale mentor.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also a Spirit of Caregiving facilitator. How could I forget that,&rdquo; she added.</p><p>One of Rashad&rsquo;s most memorable GirlTrek accomplishments occurred last Thanksgiving in Summerville, S.C., when she talked approximately 60 of her family members into participating in an informal 5K (3.1-mile) walk to celebrate her grandfather&rsquo;s 102nd birthday.</p><p>The Thomas Family walkers all wore bright blue &ldquo;Family 5K&rdquo; T-shirts and some held signs that read, &ldquo;We walk for healthier bodies, families and communities.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two of my sisters in South Carolina and one in Atlanta have joined GirlTrek and have seen their health improve just by walking, too&rdquo; said Rashad. &ldquo;They want to hold a Family 5K every year now.&rdquo;</p><p>Since becoming a GirlTrek organizer in 2016, Rashad has inspired more than 80 other black women to join the growing health movement, including Lynn Sherman, director of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/about-us/social-responsibility\" target=\"_blank\">Community Engagement&nbsp;</a>for Baptist Health.</p><p>&ldquo;When Sharon pitched the idea of getting our Baptist Health faith-based partners involved with GirlTrek, I was thrilled,&rdquo; said Sherman, who started a GirlTrek walking group in her neighborhood. &ldquo;Walking is healing. I believe the GirlTrek walking movement has caught on because the healing is inspirational and contagious.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Interested in applying for a community health program or project in Northeast Florida?

The ACS now says people who meet the criteria below should be screened at age 45, not 50.</p><p>People are considered to be at average risk if they do not have:</p><ul><li>A personal history of colorectal cancer or certain types of polyps</li><li>A family history of colorectal cancer</li><li>A personal history of inflammatory bowel disease</li><li>A confirmed or suspected hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome</li><li>A personal history of getting radiation to the abdomen or pelvic area to treat a prior cancer</li></ul><p>According to its research findings published this year in a clinical cancer journal, the ACS believes earlier screenings will result in more lives saved from colorectal cancer.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/colon-and-rectal-surgeon/dr-ron-landmann-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ron G. Landmann</a>, MD, colon and rectal surgeon and chief of Colorectal Surgery at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>, wholeheartedly agrees.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatRight u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable fr-fil\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/c_scale,w_252/v1544034537/Juice/ron-landmann-md-8x10.jpg\" alt=\"Landmann\"></div><p>&ldquo;Despite the tremendous improvements in survival we have seen with screening for and treatment of colorectal polyps or cancer over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer in the younger patient population &ndash; those under the age of 50,&rdquo; said Dr. Landmann.</p><p>&ldquo;Signs of bleeding, pain or a change in bowel habits should be investigated early. In many cases, a colonoscopy can prevent a colon cancer from developing and will save your life.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Testing and treatment options</strong></p><p>There are two main types of testing options for colorectal cancer: a fecal DNA stool-based test and a visual exam of the colon and rectum, commonly known as a colonoscopy. Your health care provider will help you decide which test is the best option for you.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In the event of an abnormal test, your primary care provider or specialist can help you choose the appropriate surgical procedure. The type of surgery used depends on the stage or extent of the cancer, where it is, and the goals of treatment. Radiation and chemotherapy may occasionally be needed in addition to surgery.</p><p>In the U.S., the large majority of colorectal cancer procedures are performed using an open approach, where a surgeon uses a long midline cut in the abdomen to gain access to the bowel. This surgical approach usually has a long, usually painful recovery.</p><p>Some oncology surgeons use modern technology to limit the length of the cut during bowel surgery. One of the benefits of these laparoscopic or minimally invasive robotic surgeries is that recovery time is nearly cut in half</p><p>An expert in robot-assisted colorectal surgery, Dr. Landmann is experienced in these operations that not only help with recovery time, but lead to improved outcomes and survival, and help you quickly return to your normal, everyday activities.</p><p>&ldquo;Our development and experience with newer robotic surgical techniques allows for best outcomes in our patients. In most cases, robot-assisted colorectal surgery is available and your surgeon can help decide if it is right for you.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2017, 135,430 new cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed in the U.S. But thanks to early detection, there are more than 1 million colon cancer survivors living in the U.S. today.</p><p><em>For more information on colonoscopies or to schedule an appointment, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care/request-appointment\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Primary Care</em></a><em>&nbsp;or call 904-202-4YOU (4968).</em></p>",

But he was forced to give up the decathlon, a two-day test of versatility and stamina, after suffering a back injury his freshman year.</p><p>&ldquo;I slipped a disk throwing the hammer and it took me six months to recover,&rdquo; recalled Dr. Frykberg, who suffered a hamstring injury the following year, but set team-high marks in the high jump and personal-best throws in the javelin his junior year.</p><p>Dr. Frykberg didn&rsquo;t intend to follow his late father, a legendary trauma surgeon, into the medical field.</p><p>But an eight-week summer stint as a volunteer in the trauma center at UT Medical Center changed his career outlook.</p><p>&ldquo;I fell in love with the hospital and the selfless work the staff was doing there. It made me appreciate what my dad was doing in Jacksonville on a daily basis,&rdquo; said Dr. Frykberg. &ldquo;That summer, I decided to switch my major from biomedical engineering to pre-med because I wanted to work in patient care.&rdquo;</p><p>Two years later, Dr. Frykberg gave up his final year of athletic eligibility to enter the Medical College of Virginia, the same school his late father attended.</p><p>&ldquo;Brett was one of my favorite athletes because of his big heart and his huge desire to accomplish something big, like being accepted into medical school,&rdquo; said former Tennessee track coach Bill Webb.</p><p>Playing a sport in college proved advantageous for Dr. Frykberg when he was interviewing to get into medical school.</p><p>&ldquo;Turns out, time management is one of the biggest things they look for in prospective medical students,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As a decathlete, I had competed in 10 different events. So, I knew how to multi-task.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Bone-preserving procedure</strong></p><p>A former chief resident at the University Florida College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville, Dr. Frykberg realized he had a strong interest in the field of joint replacement and complex revision surgery, or surgery to replace or compensate for a failed implant. He became immensely interested in hip disease in the young, active adult during a fellowship in New York City.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable fr-fil\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/c_scale,w_340/v1544034544/Juice/brett-frykberg-md-8x10.jpg\" alt=\"Frykberg\"></div><p>&ldquo;In the past, younger people with hip problems had to stop whatever activity they enjoyed. Their only option was total hip replacement,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;While I was training in New York, I started performing hip resurfacing procedures, which involves removing arthritis in the affected hip while leaving healthy tissue in place.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Frykberg said many of his patients who have undergone hip resurfacing procedures are back competing in recreational sports like tennis, golf, cycling and running, within three months. He uses the latest technology, including robotic-assisted and computer-navigated joint replacement surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a privilege to be able to give back the active lifestyle my patients may have lost with the presence of hip and knee arthritis. Many athletes continue to play with chronic hip pain. Hip resurfacing procedures are less invasive and can help keep them in the sport they love. It&rsquo;s a bone-preserving procedure and another option in JOI&rsquo;s repertoire.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Family of caregivers</strong></p><p>Dr. Frykberg comes from a family of caregivers. His late father, Eric R. Frykberg, MD, was chief of General Surgery at a local hospital. A plaque honoring his memory and his 30 years of service hangs in the trauma center there.</p><p>As a general surgeon in the Navy, Dr. Frykberg&rsquo;s father directed the surgical care of the wounded following the 1983 suicide truck bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon.</p><p>&ldquo;Most people remember the bombing, but very few know that many casualties were avoided and lives saved because Lt. Cmdr. Eric Frykberg of the USS Iwo Jima took it upon himself to establish a system of casualty triage at shore-based medical facilities in Beirut before that tragic day,&rdquo; recalled Joe Tepas, MD, chief of the division of Pediatric Surgery at UF Health Jacksonville. &ldquo;His foresight saved many lives.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Brett Frykberg&rsquo;s older sister, Erica Glas, DO, is a Baptist Health-affiliated OB/GYN. His younger sister, Jessica Vogel, is a recreational therapist in Jacksonville.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t always want to be a physician like my father. I wanted to do something different,&rdquo; said Dr. Frykberg &ldquo;But I eventually found my calling.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Specially trained physicians at JOI provide comprehensive care for muscles, bones and joints.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Registering for products, clothing and toys for your new baby is an exciting part of being pregnant &mdash; and choosing what comes into the nursery helps make it feel all the more real! And who better to make suggestions than Kathleen Hugo, RN, IBCLC, women&rsquo;s resource coordinator at Baptist Health. She works directly with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/pregnancy-and-childbirth\" target=\"_blank\">expectant and brand new moms</a> in addition to organizing classes that help them prepare for their new arrival.</p><p><strong>Must-have or forget about it?</strong></p><p>For starters, what do the nurses on the hospital&rsquo;s maternity/newborn floor recommend for babies once they are home?</p><p>&ldquo;One of the biggest things we suggest is a white noise machine, said Hugo. &ldquo;We find that if you purchase an actual white noise machine as opposed to using an app, it has a more effective frequency. You can use it for years to help your children go to sleep and cancel out other noises in the house.&rdquo;</p><p>And what&rsquo;s the most overhyped product that usually ends up collecting dust?</p><p>&ldquo;Warmers for the baby wipes!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Parents often say that wasn&rsquo;t really something they needed or used.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Safety + supervision = happy mom and baby</strong></p><p>But more importantly than lists of best and worst, new parents should be concerned about the safety of the products they purchase or register for. Hugo says ensuring products are reputable and always supervising your baby while using them is key to preventing injuries.</p><p>&ldquo;You can go out and buy lots of products, but you need a watchful and attentive adult at all times. Many products work beautifully, but that&rsquo;s the key to using all of them safely. The Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association certifies over 2,000 baby products. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also describes the types of toys that are recommended for each stage of development,&rdquo; Hugo explained. &ldquo;The AAP and Safe Kids USA are our two places we like to get our information. We live in a world where everyone feels they can consult Dr. Google or poll their Facebook friends and get lots of answers, but rely on people who are trained, updated and educated for best practices.&rdquo;</p><p>New parents should also keep a close eye on recalls in case one of their baby&rsquo;s favorite rockers or play mats shows up on the list.</p><p>&ldquo;Check recall lists as they become available to make sure products deemed safe in the past haven&rsquo;t started showing defects over time. Parents have a tendency to throw out those registration cards that come with products when you get them, but the main purpose of filling them out is so the company can notify you of recalls. It&rsquo;s something parents should always do,&rdquo; Hugo said.</p><p>Safe sleep is a major concern for new parents. Hugo said keeping your baby safe is not about buying the fanciest products.</p><p>&ldquo;Many parents will go out and buy sleep apnea monitors to put on the beds themselves, and those are not recommended,&rdquo; explained Hugo. &ldquo;There are products out there like this that give parents a false sense of security. Physicians can order these monitors, but those products are not the same. &nbsp;Any device with a medical purpose should be prescribed and installed by medical professional.&rdquo;</p><p>Hugo says many moms spend time choosing the right baby carrier for them depending on their needs and lifestyle.</p><p>&ldquo;There are many different types of baby carriers. We explain to moms that they do have benefits and disadvantages, and they need to be used properly or they can be dangerous to a baby in terms of suffocation or hip issues if they&rsquo;re in them for extended times,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><strong>Age-appropriate purchases</strong></p><p>Aside from checking for certified baby products, inspect each product you want for the recommended age of use.</p><p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re purchasing anything for your baby, the age range listed on a toy is a guideline for purchasers taking into consideration safety, development and interest level &mdash; it&rsquo;s about both their physiology and their mental age,&rdquo; said Hugo. &ldquo;For example, if it&rsquo;s not appropriate for your three-month-old, don&rsquo;t purchase a play mat for a child who is six months to a year old thinking it&rsquo;ll last longer.&rdquo;</p><p>To access expert information about pregnancy and planning for your baby, sign up for a course at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/patient-info/classes-and-events\" target=\"_blank\">baptistjax.com/classes</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;If you want to know how to map out your pregnancy timeline, including everything you need to get done &mdash; getting insurance, planning a shower, how to eat healthy, what your dos and don&rsquo;ts are &mdash; we can answer all of these questions and much more in our Early Pregnancy Class.

Finding time for her annual mammogram, between fighting fires and taking care of her grand kids, wasn&rsquo;t easy, to be sure. But it turned out to be the key to her survival.</p><p>Despite having no history of breast cancer in her family, she knew it was important to get checked once a year and has always encouraged other women to do the same.</p><p>&ldquo;I have friends who haven&rsquo;t had a mammogram in years. They&rsquo;re scared of the unknown,&rdquo; Horton said. &ldquo;I always think knowing and having the opportunity to fight breast cancer is so much better than not knowing.&rdquo;</p><p>Horton was diagnosed with ducal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in September 2018. Her drive for being a strong firefighter is where she found the strength to fight breast cancer.</p><p><strong>Igniting opportunity</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Horton has always chased big dreams and opportunities, just like her mother, Angela . Her family moved from Trinidad to New York City in 1994. She worked as an emergency medical technician (EMT) prior to becoming a firefighter in 2010. Someone at her church wanted to recruit her husband, Alton, for the fire department and she thought, &ldquo;I can do this just as well as my husband could.&rdquo;</p><p>While he stayed in his current career, she was the one to take the leap. She was thrilled to be offered a job as a firefighter with the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department (JFRD).</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t easy being one of the few women at my station,&rdquo; said Horton, thinking back to her first months on the job. &ldquo;It was a big transition and, to be honest, I struggled.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatRight u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable fr-fir\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/c_scale,h_447/v1542820043/Juice/SueHorton.jpg\" alt=\"Sue Horton\"></div><p>She fought every day to prove herself as a firefighter &ndash; for herself, for other women in the industry and for her work family at Fire Station 62 in Mandarin.</p><p><strong>Caring about carcinogens</strong></p><p>Horton is thankful for the leaders at her station and their proactive efforts to minimize risks in the sometimes-dangerous profession, while supporting her during her cancer treatment.

Contaminated gear is not allowed in the station anymore,&rdquo; said Horton. &nbsp;</p><p>In July, a new law was signed requiring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop and maintain a registry to collect data on firefighters with cancer. The hope is that this will lead researchers to better understand the impact of smoke inhalation and other job-related dangers that may lead to cancer.</p><p>Horton said there are many firefighter cancer support networks.

By 2016, it was the sixth.</p><p>Doctors have been expecting a rise in liver cancer for decades. That&rsquo;s because one of the main causes is hepatitis. Hepatitis is commonly spread through infected blood, which can happen when intravenous drug users share needles.</p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, there were a lot of Baby Boomers who experimented with IV drugs and who were exposed to hepatitis,&rdquo; Dr. Zaiden said. &ldquo;Those people are getting older and they&rsquo;re getting to an age where their livers have had enough time to scar and become damaged.&rdquo;</p><p>What doctors didn&rsquo;t factor in, though, is today&rsquo;s obesity epidemic.</p><p>Liver cancer typically happens when tissue in the liver is scarred, a condition called cirrhosis. The scarring comes from inflammation, which may be caused by hepatitis or other infectious diseases. However, it can also be caused by an excess of fat being deposited in the liver.</p><p>Alcoholism has long been known to cause cirrhosis, and the rising rate of drinking among young people is worrisome, Dr. Zaiden said. But, the newest and fastest growing cause of cirrhosis is fatty liver caused by obesity.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually a significant health concern, because one in three Americans is now considered obese,&rdquo; Dr. Zaiden said.</p><p>Obesity and fatty liver accounted for about 40 percent of new liver cancer diagnoses in 2016.</p><p>There is no standard screening test for liver cancer, and the prognosis is not good. Early-stage liver cancer&mdash;before it has spread&mdash;has a 31 percent survival rate. Once spread, the rate drops to 3 percent.</p><p>Even when the disease is caught at an early stage, it&rsquo;s very tough to fight.</p><p>&ldquo;The problem is the liver has often already been damaged by cirrhosis,&rdquo; Dr. Zaiden said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re removing the visible cancer, but the clock is ticking on the rest of the liver.&rdquo;</p><p>Many patients seek a liver transplant. And, that is difficult to get.</p><p><strong>How to prevent liver cance</strong></p><p>Doctors&rsquo; No. 1 strategy in fighting liver cancer is an ounce of prevention. That means:</p><ul><li>If you are a heavy drinker or you abuse alcohol, cut back.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t do IV drugs.

Maybe you&rsquo;re feeling a little lost and unsure of what you want next in life.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-cathleen-connolly-phd\" target=\"_blank\">Cathleen Connolly, PhD,</a> a psychologist at the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a> Beaches location, unhappiness in many of our lives comes from three primary sources:</p><ul><li>Chronic stress that wears a person out physically and mentally (i.e., an overwhelming workload, long hours, chronic pain, financial stress or caregiving stress)</li><li>Loneliness and not having a strong support network or connections with others</li><li>Lacking a sense of purpose in one&rsquo;s life, whether it is in your work or your &nbsp;role (i.e.., student, mother, father)</li></ul><p>But despite these imperfect situations, the trick to feeling happier is surprisingly simple: choose your attitude, and then take steps to reinforce it.</p><p>&ldquo;Viktor Frankl was a Holocaust concentration camp survivor and psychiatrist who said, &lsquo;Everything can be taken from a man but one thing; the last of the human freedoms &mdash; to choose one&rsquo;s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one&rsquo;s own way.&rsquo; This is the key to most life situations,&rdquo; said Dr. Connolly. &ldquo;Each person has to focus on what is in their control that day, what they can find a positive in and how they can be kind to themselves in the process.&rdquo;</p><p>She gives the example of a bad day at work. Reminding yourself you are providing a livelihood for your family may highlight the positive about what you&rsquo;re enduring. &ldquo;Also, combat any negative feelings with self-compassion &mdash; not expecting perfection of yourself each day. Allow time for self-care, and praise your small victories for the day.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Connolly also recommends exercising gratitude daily to maintain positive emotions in the face of negative situations or stress.</p><p>&ldquo;Review the day and focus on three to five things you are grateful for. Write in a journal focusing on gratitude for your gifts, like intelligence or good health, and other gifts, which could be as simple as nice weather. Focus on saying thank you more often, especially in family situations for things we usually take for granted. &lsquo;Thank you for doing the dishes&rsquo; can go a long way for both people,&rdquo; she explained.</p><p><strong>Happiness tips</strong></p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable fr-fil\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1543416547/Juice/Ways_to_be_happier-2nd_image.jpg\" alt=\"journal\"></div><p>&ldquo;Happiness is a feeling, so it is transitory, but it&rsquo;s also the result of doing actions that contribute to it, like being grateful, doing self-care activities, being with others, etc. Each individual can be purposeful in doing activities that contribute to their happiness. Happiness researchers &mdash; Action for Happiness is one such organization &mdash; have summed the following from happiness research. They call it GREAT DREAM.&rdquo;</p><ul><li><strong>G</strong>iving &mdash; doing things for others, such as volunteering or offering help to a friend</li><li><strong>R</strong>elating &mdash; connecting with people, whether meeting new ones or spending time with friends or family</li><li><strong>E</strong>xercising &mdash; taking care of your body, whether that means time at the gym or simply taking a walk</li><li><strong>A</strong>ppreciating &mdash; awareness of what you do each day and observing the joys of the world around you</li><li><strong>T</strong>rying out &mdash; doing new things and exploring opportunities</li><li><strong>D</strong>irection &mdash; working towards a goal at work, in a hobby or anywhere</li><li><strong>R</strong>esilience &mdash; bouncing back after something negative</li><li><strong>E</strong>motion &mdash; being positive about what you do and reframing negative thoughts</li><li><strong>A</strong>cceptance &mdash; acknowledging we all have faults and that things go wrong, but they don&rsquo;t determine your value</li><li><strong>M</strong>eaning &mdash; being part of something bigger</li></ul><p>While these tips have been proven to turn a bad day around, they may not work for everyone.

There was the pill, IUDs, diaphragms and condoms.</p><p>Today there&rsquo;s the pill, the patch, the ring, the shot, the implant, and a plethora of hormonal and non-hormonal IUDs. Are they safe? Are they effective? Why pick one instead of another?</p><p>&ldquo;The right decision is very much dependent on the woman you&rsquo;re speaking with,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/obstetrician-and-gynecologist/dr-kelley-stoddard-md\" target=\"_blank\">Kelley Stoddard, MD,</a> an obstetrician and gynecologist with North Florida OB/GYN who delivers at Baptist Medical Center South. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no cookie-cutter way to do it. You have to individualize it to each patient.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Narrowing down the options</strong></p><p>A simple way to begin is by starting with what you&rsquo;ve already used, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/obstetrician-and-gynecologist/dr-christina-adams-md\" target=\"_blank\">Christina Adams, MD,</a> an obstetrician and gynecologist with North Florida OB/GYN who delivers at Baptist Beaches.</p><p>&ldquo;If a woman is happy with what she is using, then I say let&rsquo;s not fix what&rsquo;s not broken,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The best birth control method is the method you will consistently use.&rdquo;</p><p>Most women begin with the pill. That&rsquo;s because most start using birth control as teenagers.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what their friends use, it&rsquo;s what their moms have experienced, and it&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re comfortable with,&rdquo; Dr. Adams said.</p><p>After that, if a woman doesn&rsquo;t like her current birth control method, Dr. Adams will narrow down what she didn&rsquo;t like about it and find another method that will get rid of the problem.</p><p><strong>Choices guided by health conditions, goals and lifestyle</strong></p><p>Dr. Stoddard begins by ruling out any birth control method a woman shouldn&rsquo;t use because of her personal or family medical history.</p><p>If she or a family member has a history of blood clots, Dr. Stoddard will steer her away from the pill, the patch and the NuvaRing&reg; because they all contain estrogen.</p><p>&ldquo;Estrogen and blood clotting disorders don&rsquo;t mix,&rdquo; Dr. Stoddard said, &ldquo;because estrogen-containing birth control can increase your risk for blood clots.&rdquo;</p><p>Smoking increases the risk of blood clots, too, and women over 35 who smoke shouldn&rsquo;t use medication with estrogen at all.</p><p>After that, Dr. Stoddard considers a woman&rsquo;s goals and her lifestyle.</p><p>Besides preventing pregnancy, does she want to even out irregular cycles? Lighten or eliminate her period altogether? The pill and other hormonal birth control methods are able to do both of these things.</p><p>A woman&rsquo;s habits also come into play.</p><p>&ldquo;Some women are very bad pill takers and they&rsquo;re not going to take a pill every day,&rdquo; Dr. Stoddard said.</p><p>For them, long-acting medications work better. The patch and the NuvaRing&reg; deliver the same hormones as the pill, but are replaced every week and every month respectively. Nexplanon&reg;, a small device inserted in the arm by a physician or other health care provider, releases hormones for three years. And an IUD can last five to 10 years.</p><p><strong>Side effects may factor in</strong></p><p>Some women don&rsquo;t like the side effects of their birth control method. It&rsquo;s the main reason women come to Dr. Adams wanting a change. Some get headaches, nausea, anxiety or mood swings from hormones. Others get excessive cramping or heavier periods from IUDs.</p><p>&ldquo;Some women don&rsquo;t like any birth control they try,&rdquo; Dr. Adams said. &ldquo;So then you&rsquo;ve got condoms and spermicide. The old-fashioned birth control methods still work if you use them regularly and in the right way.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Bothersome side effects of the pill have been decreasing over the years as medical science has learned that the medication is still effective at much lower hormone doses.</p><p>&ldquo;Thirty-five micrograms used to be a low-dose pill,&rdquo; Dr. Stoddard said. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s the highest dose you can get.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Biggest changes: No more periods and long-lasting birth control</strong></p><p>One of the most dramatic changes in birth control has been the rise of long-acting, reversible contraception, Dr. Adams said. That includes the Nexplanon&reg; implant and IUDs. The failure rates of these methods are lower than the pill, about 0.1 percent compared to 1 percent, because of less user error.</p><p>&quot;If you have to take a pill every day, it&rsquo;s easy to miss one.&rdquo; Dr. Adams said.</p><p>Another practice on the rise is getting rid of having a period altogether, Dr. Stoddard said. Women have active lifestyles. Some want to control if and when they have their periods, so they don&rsquo;t worry about their cycle while they&rsquo;re on vacation or on their wedding day.</p><p>&ldquo;Most female OB/GYNs use some sort of method that makes their periods go away,&rdquo; Dr. Stoddard said, &ldquo;because, you can do it. It&rsquo;s safe. And why have a period if you don&rsquo;t need to?&rdquo;</p><p><br></p><p><em>To learn more about which birth control method is right for you, contact your&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Health primary care physician</em></a><em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/womens-health\" target=\"_blank\"><em>OB/GYN</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Half of all women in the U.S. have dense breasts. Although common, many women aren&rsquo;t sure what that means.&nbsp;</p><p>Breasts are comprised of two types of tissue &ndash; dense tissue, which is fibrous and glandular, and non-dense, fatty tissue. Viewed on a mammogram, breasts with more dense tissue than fatty tissue are considered to be dense.&nbsp;</p><p>Having dense breasts makes it harder to detect <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center/breast-cancer\">breast cancer</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;When you have a mammogram, fatty tissue appears dark, but dense breast tissue appears as a solid white area,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/general-surgeon/dr-beth-lesnikoski-md\">Beth-Ann Lesnikosksi,</a> MD, FACS, a surgeon and director of the Breast Program at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center.</a> &ldquo;Because tumors and calcifications also appear white on a mammogram, they can be harder to find when there is dense breast tissue.&rdquo;</p><p>According the National Cancer Institute, women with dense breasts have a higher risk of breast cancer than women with fatty breasts, and the risk increases with increasing breast density.&nbsp;</p><p>The first step to find out if you have dense breasts is to have an annual mammogram, recommended for women 40 and older. &ldquo;Neither you nor your doctor can detect dense breast tissue through a self-exam or clinical exam. Getting a mammogram is the only way to know,&rdquo; Dr. Lesnikoski said.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have dense breasts, understanding your breast cancer risk can help you and your physician make the best treatment decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s risk of breast cancer and her breast density are, in part, determined by how much estrogen she has,&rdquo; said Dr. Lesnikoski. &ldquo;It is really quite normal for premenopausal women to have dense breasts on a mammogram because estrogen levels are higher prior to menopause. The elevation in breast cancer risk is more significant for women who still have dense breasts after menopause.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you have dense breasts or not, there are a number of other factors that can affect a woman&rsquo;s breast cancer risk, such as lifestyle, family history and menstrual history, among others.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Talk to your doctor about your breast cancer risks,&rdquo; said Dr. Lesnikoski. Women with dense breasts and other risk factors may want to consider consulting in the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Program at Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center to determine their lifetime risk percentage. For those with a family history of breast cancer, genetic counseling is also available.&nbsp;</p><p>For women with dense breast tissue, other screening methods for detecting breast cancer may be recommended. Baptist Health offers a range of screening options, including digital 2D and 3D mammography, breast MRIs and molecular breast imaging.

If women in your family have had breast cancer, your doctor may recommend that you start getting mammograms earlier and more frequently. Knowing your family&rsquo;s health history can help your primary care physician make recommendations based on factors you can control.</p><p>When talking to your relatives, pay close attention to the following in family history:</p><ul><li>Cancers that have a higher genetic predisposition such as breast, ovarian, prostate, etc.</li><li>Heart disease, especially in a male relative younger than 55 and/or a female relative younger than 65&nbsp;</li><li>Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, celiac disease, thyroid disease, etc.</li><li>Blood abnormalities such as sickle cell, frequent blood clots, miscarriages, etc.</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>Mental health disorders</li></ul><p>&quot;Unfortunately, I have quite a few patients who know their family members had cancer but they don&rsquo;t know what kind. Specific details are key because some cancers have a higher genetic predisposition than others,&rdquo; said Dr. Sastre. He added that knowing the age of onset is one of the most critical elements of information to collect.</p><p>In addition to knowing family history, this <a href=\"https://baptistwellness.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Preventative Health Scorecard</a> can help determine if your screenings meet recommendations for your age group, helping to lessen risks for certain health issues.</p><p><strong>Take notes&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Dr. Calhoun always asks patients, &ldquo;What sort of things do you have to worry about with your health? Which diseases or illnesses are in your family that I may not know about?&rdquo; She said these are the same questions you can ask your family members.</p><p>Other questions to ask:</p><ul><li>What do I need to know about our family health history to best prepare for the future?</li><li>How/why did previous family members pass away? What was their age? What were their lifestyle habits (smoking, activity level, etc.)?</li><li>Are there any records available?</li><li>Any hospital records, discharge summaries, surgical records for relatives will help you collect detailed data that could benefit other family members as well.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;When gathering information about relatives, aim for at least three generations of information. However, first-degree relatives are the most important. Ask about the health histories of siblings, parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles and first cousins.</p><p>Wondering how to keep track of all of this information? The <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/patient-info/my-baptist-connect\" target=\"_blank\">My Baptist Connect Patient Portal</a>, a secure website you can use to collect your personal health care information, has a section for family history. Print out these notes and bring them to each of your doctor&rsquo;s appointments. This record will help you stay organized and provide updated and consistent information to each of your physicians.</p><p><strong>It&rsquo;s in your genes&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Over the past few years, at-home DNA genetic testing and ancestry test kits ( i.e., 23andMe, AncestryDNA&trade;, etc.) &nbsp;have become extremely popular.</p><p>Dr. Sastre gives a &ldquo;heads up&rdquo; to people utilizing these DNA services, &ldquo;These tests seem interesting but I always recommend having a specialist explain the meaning of certain health conditions uncovered in family history.&rdquo; Though they may seem fun, they can uncover some pretty critical information when it comes to health history.</p><p>The most accurate way to gather information about your genetic health, other than talking to your family, is to talk to your doctor about whether additional gene testing is right for you. Genetic counseling is recommended for people undergoing genetic testing to help patients understand what the results could mean for your health.</p><p><strong>Happy and healthy? Great!</strong></p><p>Even if your family has trends of genetic conditions, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you are guaranteed to develop one of them. Still, you should work with your doctor to make a personalized plan of preventative efforts. It can be as simple as wearing sunscreen to prevent skin cancer, getting vaccines to prevent disease and participating in regular screenings for cancer.</p><p>After your tummy is full this holiday season, talk about the past to help you better prepare for the future.</p><p><em>If you&rsquo;re in good health, celebrate and be thankful this holiday season. If you discover there are areas that need more attention or you find out new information in your family history, contact your primary care physician to develop a customized care plan.

Since age 3, Gunnar has had seven more amputation surgeries and four pairs of prosthetics, and has received specialized <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/orthopedics\" target=\"_blank\">orthopedic care</a> from <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-orthopedic-surgeon/dr-eric-loveless-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Loveless, MD,</a> pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s and Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville. He also sees Mike Wright, a pediatric orthotist/prosthetist with Nemours Jacksonville, who ensures Gunnar&rsquo;s prosthetics fit properly; Gunnar also undergoes physical therapy at <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/rehabilitation\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Rehabilitation</a> as needed.</p><p>January 26, 2019, is the 10th anniversary <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrenschallenge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Challenge</a>, where Gunnar will be honored as one of the Wolfson 55 &mdash; a group of patients there to share their inspiring stories. He&rsquo;s excited to complete the 1-Mile Fun Run, and his family is considering putting together a relay team called &ldquo;Gunnar&rsquo;s Runners.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They had to amputate about an inch or two of extra tissue on his legs and shape them for prosthetics. That was the first surgery. They&rsquo;ve had to go in and shave the tibia bones because they grew into spikes. It&rsquo;s just reshaping his legs as he grows so he can fit the prosthetics in the best way,&rdquo; said Chester.</p><p>It may sound like a sad story, but when people approach Gunnar&rsquo;s mother and express their sympathy for her son&rsquo;s condition, she doesn&rsquo;t really see why.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatRight u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable fr-fil\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1542137833/Juice/gunnar_juice_secondary.jpg\" alt=\"Gunner\"></div><p>&ldquo;Countless people have come up to us crying and telling us they&rsquo;re so sorry, and I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;Why?!&rsquo; He&rsquo;s a pistol so it doesn&rsquo;t even stop him. We talk about it like it&rsquo;s not abnormal, because this is our normal,&rdquo; Chester said.</p><p>In fact, Gunnar is thriving &mdash; not in spite of his prosthetic legs, but because of them. When he took his first steps, he took them in prosthetics. He runs and plays with friends at church and keeps up with his fellow kindergartners at Mosaic Day School. He loves to ride his bike and he&rsquo;s always dancing, even in the middle of the grocery store. In his mom&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;If he gets the chance, he&rsquo;s busting a move.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He talks about what he calls his &lsquo;nubbies&rsquo; all the time, and we say we have a &lsquo;prosthetic&rsquo; sense of humor. We&rsquo;ll be in the grocery store or somewhere and his prosthetic will fall off and he&rsquo;ll be like, &lsquo;Whoops, my leg fell off again.&rsquo; He will take off his legs and ask people to tickle the bottom of his prosthetic feet and then laugh when they do,&rdquo; said Chester. &ldquo;I just know God is going to use him for something great. He&rsquo;s great at playing the drums, and he plays with his dad. Maybe that&rsquo;s his calling.&rdquo;</p><p>The Chester family has been stationed in Jacksonville with the U.S. Coast Guard since 2012. They&rsquo;re currently hoping not to relocate so Gunnar can remain in the care of his long-time team of specialists at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care.</p><p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t even be where we are if it wasn&rsquo;t for Wolfson and Nemours. Everyone there has always treated us like family,&rdquo; said Chester. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in the hospital and in the clinic developing those relationships. We walk in and people know who he is &mdash; it&rsquo;s like a second home. Without them, our little firecracker wouldn&#39;t be so mobile.&rdquo;</p><p><em>To register for the 55K Ultra, 55K Relay, 30K Run or 1-Mile Fun Run during the Wolfson Children&#39;s Challenge, visit <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrenschallenge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">wolfsonchildrenschallenge.com</a>.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>The unexpected can happen in the blink of an eye. Robert and Jennifer Payne were enjoying a Saturday morning at their Brunswick, Ga., home with their eight-month-old son, Liam, who they affectionately call &ldquo;Little Hulk.&rdquo;</p><p>An active infant, Liam is a happy baby and has a smile that lights up the room wherever he goes. That morning, Liam pulled himself up &ndash; a new activity he was learning &ndash; by holding onto the family&rsquo;s coffee table. Liam was so excited about his latest accomplishment.</p><p>Seconds later, he let go of the table. Instead of falling backwards, Liam tumbled to the side, hitting his head on the table&rsquo;s metal leg. Even though his mom and dad were right there, it happened abruptly and they couldn&rsquo;t stop the fall. How quickly things changed.</p><p>&ldquo;After he fell, Liam instantly started screaming and crying,&rdquo; Jennifer Payne said. &ldquo;Call it &#39;mother&rsquo;s intuition,&#39; but I knew something was terribly wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Payne called Liam&rsquo;s pediatrician, Amy Pavlou, MD, of Pediatric Associates of Brunswick. Dr. Pavlou recommended they bring Liam immediately to the Emergency Care Center at Southeast Georgia Health System&rsquo;s Brunswick campus, where they were seen by emergency physician Maria Wolf, MD.</p><p>A CT scan confirmed Liam had suffered a life-threatening epidural hematoma from head trauma. Dr. Wolf reached out to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville, which provides pediatric specialty care to children of all ages from North Florida, South Georgia and beyond.</p><p>Pediatric neurosurgeon Philipp Aldana, MD, co-medical director of the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/brain\" target=\"_blank\">Stys Neuroscience Institute at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s</a>, recommended emergency surgery.</p><p>The relationship between Southeast Georgia Health System and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s helped facilitate rapid coordination of care for Liam, who was transferred from Southeast Georgia Health System by helicopter to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. Dr. Aldana and the team at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s were waiting for Liam when he arrived.</p><p>&ldquo;As soon as Liam&rsquo;s CT scans were available at Southeast Georgia Health System&rsquo;s Emergency Care Center, Dr. Pavlou and Dr. Wolf notified our Trauma Team at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s immediately,&rdquo; said Dr. Aldana. &ldquo;Our operating room team was ready for Liam when he arrived, and he was able to enter the operating room area within 10 minutes of the helicopter landing on our helipad.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>From normal day to brain surgery</strong></p><p>In Liam&rsquo;s case, his life depended on brain surgery. He had an epidural hematoma, bleeding that happens between the outer membrane covering the brain (dura mater) and the skull as a result of head trauma. Liam&rsquo;s case is not common and only occurs in about three percent of children. Only about a tenth of those children require emergency brain surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;Liam had a very large hematoma (brain bleed) that was putting pressure on a large part of his brain,&rdquo; said Dr. Aldana. &ldquo;This can compromise the brain&rsquo;s blood supply, potentially causing a stroke. Or it can further expand and compress vital parts of the brain such as the brainstem in a process called cerebral herniation that can be fatal.&rdquo;</p><p>Liam spent three days at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s before he was discharged to go home.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Aldana was amazing &ndash; we couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better doctor,&rdquo; Payne said. &ldquo;He was honest and open, and he saved our baby&rsquo;s life. The entire staff including every doctor, PA, RN, CNA, nursing student and rehabilitation team member, will forever be in our thoughts. We are blessed they were the ones to care for Liam.&rdquo;</p><p>Liam&rsquo;s incision is healing, and &ldquo;Little Hulk&rdquo; is active, happy and alert. Liam will continue to receive follow-up care with Dr. Aldana at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;As terrible as it was, I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better outcome,&rdquo; Payne said. &ldquo;Nothing could be worse than those feelings, thoughts and minutes that we experienced. We are so grateful and thankful that day played out the way it did in the end. Prayers from all around the country were being said for our &lsquo;Little Hulk.&rsquo; It was a one-in-a-million situation, and I am forever thankful and grateful for the care we received.&quot;</p><p><br></p><p><em>For a list of pediatric outpatient specialty care offered at Wolfson Children&#39;s at Southeast Georgia Health System, visit <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/locations/brunswick\" target=\"_blank\">wolfsonchildrens.com/brunswick</a>.</em></p>",

For Lorraine Holtsinger, her daughter, Marge Holtsinger, was an easy choice for her care partner. For others, the decision can be difficult.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable fr-fil\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1541608411/Juice/Mom_at_a_craft_show_juiceSecondary.jpg\" alt=\"Lorraineatcraftshow\" style=\"width: 300px;\"></div><p>&ldquo;The relationship is successful because we are open with each other and share our needs,&rdquo; said Marge Holtsinger. As time has passed, her role as care partner has become increasingly involved but the mother and daughter&rsquo;s shared love of sewing has remained consistent.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to us that we have something we can do together that is just for fun,&rdquo; said Lorraine Holtsinger, 91. As soon as she moved in with her daughter, they built a &ldquo;happy room&rdquo; as an addition to the house &ndash; a room where they go to quilt together for hours each day.</p><p><strong>Picking a partner&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A care partner &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s a spouse, a child, a cousin, a niece, a neighbor or a friend &ndash; can be defined in many ways. It&rsquo;s a person appointed by a patient who is included as a member of the care team and can help bridge the gap between medical obligations and home.</p><p>&ldquo;Medical systems can be challenging to navigate, even if you are savvy with coordinating your affairs,&rdquo; said Lauren Madrid, a social worker at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/agewell-center-for-senior-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist AgeWell Center for Senior Health</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Baptist AgeWell Center for Senior Health is a specialized outpatient center and primary care team focused on promoting health aging for adults age 65 and over with complex needs.</p><p>&ldquo;At AgeWell, we provide resources for both the patient and the care partner,&rdquo; said geriatrician <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/geriatrician/dr-courtney-ross-md\" target=\"_blank\">Courtney Ross, MD.</a> &ldquo;We encourage this relationship for every patient because it is beneficial to have shared responsibility as health care needs increase.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The perfect fit&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When it&rsquo;s time to choose your care partner, it may feel like a big task. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s most important is to choose someone you can trust and have full disclosure with,&rdquo; said Dr. Ross. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here are five traits to consider when choosing a health care partner:</p><p><strong>1. Is the person organized?</strong> From taking notes at appointments to keeping track of prescriptions and other needs, the duties of a care partner require strong organizational skills.</p><p><strong>2. Does he or she have the time to commit?&nbsp;</strong>The care partner will be encouraged to attend all medical appointments with the patient. For some, responsibilities are minimal while others will require a lot of time.</p><p>&ldquo;At AgeWell, we really try to value the time of the care partner. We have early morning appointments for those who work. We can call a care partner in to an appointment on speaker phone, answer questions they send in a note or follow up with them after the appointment,&rdquo; said Dr. Ross.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Is the individual a good listener?</strong> A care partner will listen to both the concerns of the patient and information from the doctors.</p><p>&ldquo;I encourage the patient and care partner to talk beforehand and come to the appointment with questions to discuss,&rdquo; said Madrid.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Will this person be your partner and advocate?&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;In order to have a successful care partner relationship, it&rsquo;s important for the care partner to allow the patient to be as involved as possible in their own plan,&rdquo; said Madrid. &ldquo;Patients should feel empowered to use their abilities to do what they can. Care partners should supplement the patient, not take over.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Keys to a successful patient-care partner collaboration&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Establish needs upfront.&nbsp;</strong>The patient and care partner should time to outline their responsibilities. Being clear and up front from the beginning avoids frustration down the road. In addition, remember the needs of older adults can change over time. The patient should ask if the care partner is comfortable taking on more responsibility as time passes.</p><p><strong>Have open communication.&nbsp;</strong>Having a candid conversation about expectations and responsibilities from the beginning is key. Open communication should continue as the relationship does.</p><p>&ldquo;Choose someone you trust fully with your personal life. It&rsquo;s important to have someone present at appointments but know there are a lot of intimate details shared,&rdquo; said Dr. Ross. &ldquo;You want to have someone by your side who respects your needs.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Care partner self-care.&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough how important it is for care partners to take care of themselves,&rdquo; said Dr. Ross. &ldquo;At AgeWell, we offer resources and <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/aging-well/5-tips-to-be-a-better-caregiver\" target=\"_blank\">advice for care partners</a> in addition to the patients.

For example, Marge Holtsinger has someone come spend a few days a week with her mom so she has the opportunity to spend time with her own daughter and run errands &ndash; or to just go in the &ldquo;happy room&rdquo; alone to recharge.</p><p>Madrid and Dr. Ross both had seen patients who were hesitant to bring someone to their appointments. If it&rsquo;s overwhelming to have someone there every step of the way, they recommend starting with &ldquo;baby steps,&rdquo; and having a care partner at a few appointments then increasing involvement.</p><p>&ldquo;Picking a care partner is not about giving up your independence,&rdquo; said Dr. Ross. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about having a partner who will help advocate for you and your health.&rdquo;</p><p><em><u>Baptist AgeWell Center for Senior Health</u> is a specialized outpatient center and primary care team focused on promoting health aging for older adults (ages 65+) with complex needs.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Coffee has superpowers that can&rsquo;t be denied.</p><p>It can buoy college students through all-night cram sessions on final exams week. It can steel overworked adults for a demanding day on the job. It can make you run for the restroom following a too-long air flight. It can deliver a withdrawal migraine that flattens you for a week.</p><p>More than 85 percent of Americans consume at least one caffeinated drink per day, and coffee is the largest contributor to caffeine intake. But coffee&rsquo;s effects&mdash;and side effects&mdash;can leave us wondering whether it is a friend or foe. Researchers have examined coffee for years trying to decide. Recently, studies have tipped the balance towards healthy.</p><p>In August, a study reported in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine&nbsp;</em>said people who drank coffee, no matter which kind or how much, were less likely to die over a 10-year period than non-coffee drinkers. The findings suggest coffee drinking can be part of a healthy diet and offers reassurance to coffee drinkers, researchers said.</p><p>That may be true, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-muhammad-ghazi-md\" target=\"_blank\">Muhammad Ghazi, MD</a>, a family physician with Baptist Primary Care. But whether you see health benefits from coffee depends on a lot of case-by-case factors.</p><p>&ldquo;This type of research is not a clinical trial. Things are not as simple once you get into the clinical world with multiple variables affecting patients&rsquo; health,&rdquo; he said.</p><p><strong>The ups and downs of coffee</strong></p><p>Research has shown coffee lowers people&rsquo;s risk for cardiovascular disease, liver cancer, colon cancer and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, Dr. Ghazi said. A Johns Hopkins study showed coffee improves memory over a 24-hour period. European studies have shown people who drink coffee are less likely to develop Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p><p>However, the benefits of coffee peak at three to four cups a day. There are reasons why things may not go that way in real life.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Not everybody can drink that much coffee. I personally get heart palpitations after two cups,&rdquo; Dr. Ghazi said. &ldquo;Also if you add sugar or cream, that&rsquo;s not going to be beneficial, or it may cancel out beneficial effects.&rdquo;</p><p>Certain people won&rsquo;t feel good drinking coffee either. If you suffer from a leaky bladder, coffee will increase your symptoms because coffee makes people urinate more often, Dr. Ghazi said. Coffee stimulates the cardiovascular system, which can be fine in a healthy person. Not so much if you have an underlying heart condition.</p><p>&ldquo;It can give you high blood pressure and abnormal rhythms,&rdquo; Dr. Ghazi said. &ldquo;Too much caffeine can actually worsen your health.&rdquo;</p><p>In other cases, coffee delivers beneficial effects. Caffeine can stimulate the colon and relieve constipation, Dr. Ghazi said. It can smooth and dilate muscles in the respiratory tract, which can ease lung disease symptoms slightly.</p><p>Caffeine appears in some pain medications, especially those used for migraines, Dr. Ghazi said. But doctors are reluctant to prescribe caffeine for pain because of some downsides.</p><p>&ldquo;It has an adverse effect on people who have osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It can weaken bones if used for long periods of time,&rdquo; he said.</p><p><strong>Coffee and your brain</strong></p><p>Coffee works its stimulating magic in your brain within 15 minutes of entering the bloodstream. The caffeine in coffee is chemically similar to adenosine, which is a &ldquo;tiredness&rdquo; hormone in the brain.</p><p>Adenosine accumulates during the day, locking into receptors in the brain and making you feel more and more tired. Caffeine works by attaching to brain receptors in place of the adenosine, blocking the tiredness effect.</p><p>Because caffeine is a drug, people who drink coffee regularly become addicted to it. The brain over time creates extra receptors to compensate for the ones being blocked by coffee, which means you&rsquo;ll have to drink more and more to have the same effect.</p><p>Withdrawal from coffee delivers an energy crash. You may have a lack of energy, headaches, drowsiness and irritability, and you may even experience nausea and vomiting, Dr. Ghazi said. In extreme cases, people may alternate between caffeine and depressants like alcohol to control their energy and mood.</p><p>&ldquo;Addiction is a reality in our society,&rdquo; Dr. Ghazi said. &ldquo;So my message is, balance is everything. If your balance is off, you lose potential benefits, and coffee can actually do harm.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Whether coffee is helpful or harmful is a very individual matter which depends on underlying conditions and risk factors. For answers about coffee in your diet, contact your primary care physician.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>You&rsquo;re coughing, achy and weary. You call your doctor, and he prescribes bed rest and plenty of fluids. But wait, isn&rsquo;t there a pill for that? Sometimes yes. Sometimes no. Things were simpler a few decades ago when it seemed every ailment could be cured by a bottle of penicillin. To find out what happened, let&rsquo;s take a quick history lesson.</p><p>In the 1940s and 50s the development of antibiotics transformed the way doctors fought diseases by protecting patients against life-threatening illnesses like pneumonia, diarrhea and skin infections.</p><p>In the last two decades, fueled by antibiotic overuse, the rise of superbugs accelerated, making a growing number of infections harder to treat.</p><p>Today, antibiotics are still a critical tool in fighting bacterial infection. But doctors are a lot more measured about when they prescribe them.</p><p><strong>Antibiotic dangers&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Any time antibiotics are used, they can cause antibiotic resistance. This happens when bacteria develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at least 30 percent of the antibiotics used in outpatient settings in the U.S. are prescribed unnecessarily.</p><p>One reason antibiotics may be overused is because patients insist their doctors order them, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-jonathan-gonzalez-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Gonzalez, MD</a>, a family doctor with Baptist Primary Care on Beach Blvd.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to tell people who really feel sick to watch and wait for a few days,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But sometimes patients don&rsquo;t need antibiotics. When we treat stuff that can&rsquo;t really be cured by antibiotics, we end up creating resistance.&rdquo;</p><p>Antibiotic overuse is no joke. Dr. Gonzalez once treated a patient who was hospitalized for two weeks with a bad skin infection on his leg. He had taken antibiotics for ear and sinus infections many times over the years.</p><p>&ldquo;It took much longer to fight the skin infection. Because of resistance, they had to keep switching between antibiotics to treat him,&rdquo; Dr. Gonzalez said. &ldquo;People think antibiotics are always good. But they can cause harm too.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Antibiotic use and overuse</strong></p><p>Antibiotics fight bacteria, not viruses. They can treat illnesses like strep throat, whooping cough and urinary tract infections. They don&rsquo;t treat common colds, flu, or most sore throats and sinus infections.</p><p>Upper respiratory tract infections are a big culprit when it comes to antibiotic overuse, Dr. Gonzalez said. Nine times out of 10, these infections are viral, not bacterial.</p><p>&ldquo;The problem is patients come in a few days after they&rsquo;ve had symptoms, and that&rsquo;s how long it usually takes to peak,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They start taking antibiotics and they think they got better because of the antibiotic, when really, the virus just cleared on its own.&rdquo;</p><p>Doctors stick to clinical guidelines in deciding when to prescribe antibiotics. Many of these haven&rsquo;t changed over the years, but some have. For example, the Academy of Pediatricians today recommends that when a child has an earache, to watch and wait for three to five days.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the big ones,&rdquo; Dr. Gonzalez said. &ldquo;It used to be, if a child had an ear infection, you would just treat it with amoxicillin immediately.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>When antibiotics are the right medicine</strong></p><p>When doctors do use antibiotics, they screen patients several ways in making their decision.</p><p>The first step is to identify a source for the infection, such as the urinary tract, skin, or lungs, Dr. Gonazalez said. Then, they look for signs that symptoms are being caused by an infection. A urinary tract infection can be diagnosed by testing the urine. Pneumonia can be identified with a chest x-ray. Strep throat can be found by taking a throat culture.</p><p>Fever is one red flag that a bacterial infection is present. So is an illness that lingers for more than a week, especially if symptoms ease off, and then get worse.</p><p>One thing doctors don&rsquo;t do anymore is prescribe antibiotics over the phone.</p><p>&ldquo;A physical exam is huge,&rdquo; Dr. Gonzalez said. &ldquo;If I hear your lungs and they don&rsquo;t sound appropriate, if they have lots of congestion, or you have a really wet throat, that would trigger me to prescribe antibiotics.&rdquo;</p><p>For more answers about the proper use of antibiotics, contact your Baptist Health primary care physician. If you don&rsquo;t have a primary care provider, visit <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care/request-appointment\" target=\"_blank\">baptistjax.com/bpc-appt&nbsp;</a>to find a doctor near you.</p>",

Before undergoing radiation treatments, she paid a visit to the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-wellness-connexion-at-jca\" target=\"_blank\">Wellness Connexion</a>, a complementary health-improvement service offered to all JCA members through a partnership with Baptist Health.</p><p>Staffed by Baptist Health wellness coaches Cheryl Meyer, RN, and Amaris Chrispell, RN, the Wellness Connexion takes a comprehensive approach to helping people achieve their personal health and wellness goals by encouraging healthier behaviors and assessing health risks.</p><p>Participants take a confidential online wellness assessment, followed by screenings for blood pressure, body composition, cholesterol, glucose (blood sugar) and triglycerides, a type of fat found in blood. Wellness coaches also provide personalized coaching, health education programming and health care navigation services within the Baptist Health system.</p><p>To be eligible for the Cancer Exercise Program, participants must be currently undergoing cancer treatment or, like Hoppe, cancer free.</p><p>&ldquo;After speaking with Laura about her goals, I created a post-treatment exercise plan that included cardio, stretching and balance exercises,&rdquo; said Chrispell, a certified medical exercise specialist and a personal trainer for more than 15 years. &ldquo;She made a commitment to be here and it shows in her results.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Instilling hope</strong></p><p>Over a recent three-month period, Hoppe&rsquo;s resting heart rate fell by 25 points, as did her systolic blood pressure (the amount of pressure in the arteries during heart contractions). Her total fatigue score, which measures symptoms of both mental and physical fatigue, fell 46 points, from 47 at the start of the program to a 1 at the end.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel fatigued if I don&rsquo;t work out,&rdquo; said Hoppe, who takes part in the Cancer Exercise Program at least twice a week. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not any fun being around grandchildren if all you are doing is sitting in a chair. This Baptist Health program at the JCA gives me a reason to work on my balance and stability on a regular basis.&rdquo;</p><p>Another JCA member and cancer exercise participant who has also made significant gains in cardio, strength and balance since enrolling in the program only wishes she had started the program sooner.</p><p>&ldquo;I could have maintained my fitness levels and felt much better while I was undergoing my chemo treatment and bone marrow transplants for lymphoma,&rdquo; said Patricia Hoyt, a <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a> patient.</p><p>Last year, Hoppe was reaching for her high school yearbook in a cluttered closet when she slipped and broke her hip. Due to her hip replacement surgery and the progress she made in the Cancer Exercise Program, Hoppe was able to attend her 50th high school reunion this year in Iowa.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t just teach exercises in the program; we also instill hope,&rdquo; said Chrispell.</p><p><em>To learn about&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-wellness-connexion-at-jca\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Wellness Connexion</em></a><em>&nbsp;programs or to make an appointment with a wellness coach, call 904.365.4087.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Coenzyme Q10 is a tiny substance that interacts with enzymes (proteins) in your body.</p><p>It works like an antioxidant to protect cells in your body, and some studies have shown that CoQ10 can protect people going through cancer treatment from side effects that might damage the heart.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that the best way to shield your heart is to eat healthy and exercise daily. After you have established a healthy lifestyle, adding CoQ10 can help you protect your investment in heart health.</p><p>CoQ10 has been shown to help decrease blood pressure, help with migraine relief, lower blood sugar, improve Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, memory, and help reduce fatigue in fibromyalgia. Those are just a few of the non cardiac benefits of this substance.</p><p>In regards to your heart, CoQ10 has also been shown to help lessen narrowing of the arteries and improve vascular function. It can also help lower blood pressure.</p><p>A recent study also showed that CoQ10 can help improve heart function after a heart attack, and improve cardiac function in patients with known heart failure.</p><p><strong>How do I get CoQ10?</strong></p><p>Start with a Mediterranean-based diet and choose low-glycemic options &mdash; the fewer the carbs the better. Build your diet based on fish, olive oil, nuts, seeds, herbs, whole grains, fruits and vegetables. These foods are staples of a Mediterranean diet and they provide CoQ10 and other nutrients the natural way.</p><p>CoQ10 is mainly found in oily fish such as salmon and mackerel, organ meats like liver and kidney, and peanuts. However, these foods only provide minimal amounts of CoQ10.</p><p>The best way to get CoQ10 is with a supplement. It comes in two forms: Ubiquinone which then gets converted to Ubiquinol in the body. Most studies focus on this form of the antioxidant. Ubiquinone is generally less expensive than Ubiquinol and is the place to start. You can always ask your doctor about getting your CoQ10 levels checked, and, if they are low despite adequate doses of Ubiquinone, then switch to the more expensive Ubiquinol.</p><p>Always make sure the supplement you buy is from a reputable source. Certain seals on supplement labels show they have been tested for purity.</p><p>Consult with your doctor and let her/him know that you are taking CoQ10. It can sometimes interfere with certain medications, especially blood thinners.</p><p>Exercise and a healthy diet is the key to living an optimal healthy life; however, in certain cases supplements can help.</p><p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p><p>CoQ10 is made in every cell in your body. It is needed to maintain energy production within the cells. The highest concentrations are found in the liver, kidney, and heart because of the high amount of energy required for these organs to function.</p><p>CoQ10 acts like an antioxidant. An antioxidant is actually any substance that helps reduce cell damage, or oxidation. Oxygen breaks down atoms. Antioxidants can compensate for the breakdown by donating electrons to the resulting off-balance atoms, called free radicals.</p><p>So, antioxidants like CoQ10 help to reestablish a delicate balance within our cells. But CoQ10 levels in our body decline with age, diabetes, use of statin drugs, use of certain diabetic drugs, and some psychiatric medications. Ask your doctor if a CoQ10 supplement can be beneficial to your heart.</p><p><em>Our guest columnist is <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-mona-shah-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mona Shah, MD,</a></em><em>&nbsp;a cardiologist with&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Heart Specialists</em></a><em>&nbsp;and the only physician in Northeast Florida who is board certified in both cardiology and holistic medicine (American Board of Integrative Holistic Medicine, or ABIHM).

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Mobility for David Matthews once meant a walker with a seat on it. When navigating his way through the neighborhood supermarket, he opted for a public scooter.</p><p>Today, Matthews can walk on an incline unassisted for 30 minutes.</p><p>&ldquo;That is one incredible improvement for me,&rdquo; the 75-year-old retired engineer said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s given me a positive outlook on life that I didn&rsquo;t have before.&rdquo;</p><p>Matthews suffers from heart disease and peripheral artery disease (PAD). The latter is caused by plaque build-up in the arteries entering a person&rsquo;s arms and legs. The reduction in circulation means the blood flow into the limbs can&rsquo;t keep up with demand when exercising. When PAD patients walk, even a short distance, they may feel debilitating pain or cramping in their feet, calves, thighs, hips or buttocks.</p><p>Matthews&rsquo;s exercise physiologist became aware of his condition when he attempted to take part in the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-heart-hospital\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Hospital&nbsp;</a>Cardiac Rehabilitation Program. The pain in his legs was too intense for Matthews to walk as much as his physiologist wanted him to.</p><p>So, staff changed his exercise prescription to include PAD Supervised Exercise Therapy (SET). It&rsquo;s a type of therapy that can dramatically improve quality of life, said Mary Condorodis, Cardiac and Pulmonary Rehab coordinator for Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville and Baptist Medical Center Nassau.</p><p>In the beginning Matthews could barely walk 50 feet. By the end of therapy, he was walking 2,000 steps.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing what he&rsquo;s able to do,&rdquo; Condorodis said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had several patients who&rsquo;ve used this protocol now who are walking further with less pain.&rdquo;</p><p>People with PAD risk losing a limb due to lack of circulation. In severe cases, doctors recommend bypass surgery or inserting a stent to open the blocked artery.</p><p>But for intermittent symptoms&mdash;when the pain goes away with rest&mdash;supervised exercise therapy is now the recommended first step.</p><p>The therapy may help build collateral vessels, which operate like natural bypasses, to feed the muscles and decrease the pain, Condorodis said. For many, it&rsquo;s a welcome alternative to surgery.</p><p>Matthews had battled heart disease since his mid-50s. An undiagnosed heart condition had nearly closed his main artery. It led to quadruple heart bypass surgery and early retirement. Over the next 20 years, Matthews would have five stents placed in arteries leading to his heart to open blockages. At a recent visit with his cardiologist, Matthews asked how he could take his health to a higher level.</p><p>&ldquo;My thinking was, if I&rsquo;m going to keep having these hospital treatments and then sit on the couch and become a couch potato, I&rsquo;ll eventually expire,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>His cardiologist told him he should get into a walking program. And lose some weight.</p><p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;How do I do that?&rsquo; And he said &lsquo;You should exercise.&rsquo; But I can&rsquo;t exercise. So it went around in a circle,&rdquo; Matthews said.</p><p>People who come to the PAD Supervised Exercise Therapy program are usually deconditioned, Condorodis said.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>America is in the midst of a growing opioid epidemic. According to the American Physical Therapy Association, roughly 30 percent of patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain misuse them and upwards of 12 percent develop an opioid-use disorder. No one should have to live in pain, but doctor-prescribed opioids are not always the answer.</p><p>The National Physical Therapy Month&rsquo;s #ChoosePT campaign encourages patients to seek non-opioid treatment, including physical therapy (PT), which is a safe and effective alternative to opioids for long-term pain management.</p><p>PT provides individualized care and support through a team of highly qualified, licensed and experienced professionals. Pain is treated through movement and exercise, and has shown to be particularly effective for treating familiar conditions like low back pain, hip and knee osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia.</p><p>Benefits of PT include improved mobility, increased independence and decreased pain. Physical therapists can also help identify additional health issues, beyond your initial diagnosis, which can thereby improve your overall health and quality of life. Opioids only mask the sensation of pain and can result in depression, overdose, addiction, and withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>While there are some situations in which opioid therapy is appropriate, such as in cancer treatment or palliative care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend non-opioid approaches to pain management when the risk of opioid use outweigh the rewards.</p><p>&ldquo;Given the substantial evidence gaps on opioids, uncertain benefits of long-term use and potential for serious harm, patient education and discussion before starting opioid therapy are critical,&rdquo; the CDC said.</p><p>Before accepting a prescription for opioids, talk to your doctor about the risks and inquire about safer alternatives like physical therapy. Remember, you have the final say in how to manage your pain.</p><p><em>Our guest columnist is Debbie Headley, a certified physical therapist and the clinical manager for Baptist Rehabilitation Services.

This mental strength, Piniaz said, stems from one seemingly small thing: her hair looks just as full and healthy as the day she was diagnosed with breast cancer.</p><p>&ldquo;Not that my hair is my identity, but I&rsquo;ve always had really long hair,&rdquo; said Piniaz, a St. Augustine elementary school teacher. &ldquo;Everyone I talked to about their cancer treatment told me losing their hair was the hardest part.&rdquo;</p><p>Her surgical oncologist didn&rsquo;t mince words either. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been doing this for 28 years, and I can count on one hand the number of patients I&rsquo;ve seen who didn&rsquo;t lose their hair during chemotherapy for breast cancer,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/surgical-oncologist/dr-christopher-pezzi-md\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Pezzi, MD</a>, the chief surgical oncologist at Baptist MD Anderson.</p><p>&ldquo;I told Hillary she was going to lose her hair, but that it would grow back.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/hematologist-oncologist/dr-jennifer-crozier-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Crozier, MD</a>, a hematologist-oncologist at Baptist MD Anderson, said hair loss associated with chemotherapy treatment is quite distressing for many women, but the development of cool cap technologies to prevent hair loss has relieved some of the stress associated with a diagnosis of breast cancer.</p><p>&ldquo;The cooling cap system allows patients such as Ms. Piniaz to maintain a sense of self during such a stressful time in their life,&rdquo; Dr. Crozier said.</p><p>Motivation to keep her long tresses led Piniaz to research a relatively new option for female and male cancer patients &mdash; cold caps and scalp cooling systems that provide patients with options beyond hair loss and wigs.</p><p>The scalp-cooling system consists of tight-fitting chilled caps that reduce blood flow to the scalp, resulting in less chemotherapy drugs reaching the hair follicles. When follicles are not exposed to a full dose of chemotherapy, hair is more likely to survive treatment.</p><p>Unlike wigs, cooling caps are not currently covered by insurance. Piniaz paid for hers out of pocket. But, to her, the cost (about $300 per treatment) was worth it.</p><p>Even now, as she undergoes another year of targeted therapy, Piniaz exudes a positive outlook. She attributes some of her good vibes to lifestyle choices: organic food, regular exercise, complementary Eastern medicine (acupuncture) and, of course, toxin-free hair care products.</p><p>&ldquo;My cancer is gone, and I still feel like myself,&rdquo; Piniaz said. &ldquo;I look like myself. To me, if insurance covered cooling caps and more people knew about them, it would be the norm. I think this should be available to everyone.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>If you&rsquo;re monitoring your own blood pressure, a 10-point upward swing can be horribly disconcerting. It&rsquo;s big enough to mean the difference between perfect health and an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and cognitive impairment.</p><p>What patients don&rsquo;t commonly know, though, is just how variable blood pressure can be, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-peter-jansen-md\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Jansen, MD</a>, a family physician at Baptist Primary Care on Fleming Island. Driving in traffic can give you higher blood pressure. So can a fight with your spouse or a stressful job. Even something as simple as a full bladder. Anything that creates stress could boost your reading.</p><p>&ldquo;Technically, the way you&rsquo;re supposed to measure blood pressure is to alleviate those things,&rdquo; Dr. Jansen said. &ldquo;You should sit quietly in a chair for five minutes and then take your blood pressure on each arm.&rdquo;</p><p>In practice, that&rsquo;s not always what happens. Blood pressure readings can be wrong even in a clinical environment. A patient is nervous about seeing a doctor and the stress inches his level upward. Or a medical assistant moves a patient to another room before taking her blood pressure.</p><p>&ldquo;That blows it because now you&rsquo;ve made them stand up,&rdquo; Dr. Jansen said.</p><p>It&rsquo;s tempting for doctors to over-treat just to be on the safe side, he said. But unneeded blood pressure medicine can cause other problems, like lightheadedness or passing out.</p><p>&ldquo;When a new patient&rsquo;s blood pressure is high, I find if I have them go home and monitor for a couple of weeks, it often drops,&rdquo; said Dr. Jansen.</p><p>On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re prone to high readings, it&rsquo;s a good idea to self-monitor your blood pressure monthly, to make sure it maintains a health range most of the time.</p><p><strong>7 mistakes to avoid while taking your blood pressure</strong></p><ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\"><li>A full bladder can add 10 to 15 points your blood pressure reading.</li><li>Poor support for your feet or back while seated can raise your blood pressure reading by 6 to 10 points.</li><li>Crossing your legs can add 2 to 8 points to your reading.</li><li>Your arm hangs by your side or you hold it up while getting a reading. Your blood pressure numbers may be 10 points higher than the actual figure. Your arm should rest on a chair or counter, and the blood pressure cuff should be level with your heart.</li><li>Placing the cuff over clothing can add 5 to 50 points to your reading.</li><li>A too-small cuff can add 2 to 10 points to a reading.</li><li>Talking can add 10 points to your reading.</li></ol><p>A healthy systolic blood pressure&mdash;the &ldquo;upper&rdquo; number&mdash;should be less than 120. A range of 120 to 129 is considered elevated, and higher than 130 suggests stage 1 hypertension (high blood pressure).</p><p>Omron is a well recommended brand name in blood pressure monitors for home use, Dr. Jansen said. You can use blood pressure monitors available at pharmacies or grocery stores. Rescue stations will also check your blood pressure for you if they are not busy, or you can visit any of our Baptist Y Healthy Living Centers.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Jacksonville resident Debra Evans clicked away on the computer, searching for a fun craft that would bring her mother and sister back together. Beginning with making ceramics in the 1970s, it was the love of creativity that connected the family. Separated by distance and the hustle and bustle of everyday life, it had been a while since the daughters had one-on-one time with their mother. Evans planned a weekend of activities, called her mom and sister and hopped in the car to visit the craft store.&nbsp;</p><p>The weekend finally came. Evans scattered the crafting supplies across the table &ndash; paints, paintbrushes, pallets and &hellip;rocks. Carole Nelson, Evans&rsquo;s mom, and Susan Egan, Evans&rsquo;s sister, looked puzzled.</p><p>&ldquo;The Kindness Rock Project is based on the idea that one message, found at just the right moment, can change someone&rsquo;s day and their life,&rdquo; Evans explained to her mom and sister. She planned for them to each paint rocks with bright colors, words of affirmation and inspirational quotes before dispersing them around public places for someone else to come across at just the right time.</p><p>After a few minutes of painting, Egan said she had news to share. She had an abnormal breast biopsy and was going back to see the doctor the following week. Evans gasped, putting her hands to her chest. At that moment, she felt an irregular lump and the blood drained from her face.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatRight u-spaceLeft05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1539637592/Juice/IMG_5334_secondary.jpg\" alt=\"No one fights alone rock\"></div><p><strong>A healing journey&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Evans was diagnosed with breast cancer at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/hill-breast-center\" target=\"_blank\">Hill Breast Center</a> on the day her sister had surgery for her breast cancer. &ldquo;Rock painting saved my life,&rdquo; Evans said. &ldquo;Without the gathering to paint rocks, I have no idea where I would be today.&rdquo;</p><p>Rock painting quickly became more than just a hobby for the family. It was their inspiration, their motivation, their lifeline during treatment -- but it was never about them. It was about the power to inspire and encourage others. It was about the opportunity to spend quality time with their mom. They haven&rsquo;t missed a weekend of rock painting since the first gathering in September 2017.</p><p>&ldquo;I love that Evans found a channel for positive and healing energy. Her passion for this art has certainly enhanced her healing, and her message of hope and strength have been a gift to countless other patients,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/general-surgeon/dr-beth-lesnikoski-md\" target=\"_blank\">Beth-Ann Lesnikoski, MD</a>, director of the breast program at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>.</p><p><strong>Rocking your world &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When the rocks are painted, the women post images to their Facebook group, &ldquo;Sea Colony Rocks,&rdquo; and distribute the rocks throughout Northeast Florida. Finders of the hidden treasures post a message on the page as well. Nelson and Egan deliver rocks to their local hospitals. Evans brings rocks to Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center where she has become well known for her empowering craft.</p><p>&ldquo;The rock finds the person at just the right moment,&rdquo; Evans explained. She leaves rocks in the courtyard and waiting rooms.</p><p>&ldquo;Someone will come along and pick up a rock,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If they keep it, it was for them. If they admire it and place it back down, the message is supposed to reach someone else.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/c_scale,w_419/a_360/v1539871126/Juice/IMG_7060.jpg\" alt=\"No one fights alone rock\"></div><p>From mermaids to Jack-O-Lanterns, the images on the rocks are all inspired by the shape of the rock itself. The quotes are written to encourage others, especially cancer patients. One of her favorite quotes, originally written by Jeremy Walker, is &ldquo;The Devil whispered in my ear, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not strong enough to withstand the storm.&rsquo; Today, I whispered in the Devil&rsquo;s ear, &lsquo;I am the storm.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p><strong>A lasting legacy&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Evans, who calls herself a &ldquo;cancer warrior,&rdquo; will celebrate the end of her cancer treatment in December 2018 but was saddened by the idea that she won&rsquo;t be bringing rocks to Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center. Hagan Ace Hardware, where Evans works, found out about the project. The store is hosting a competition for people in the community to paint rocks to be entered into a prize drawing. With more than 2,000 members in the local rock-painting groups, the store hopes to gather enough rocks for Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center employees and patients to disperse for a very long time.</p><p>&ldquo;Holding a rock is like holding someone&rsquo;s hand. You know you&rsquo;re not alone,&rdquo; Evans explained. &ldquo;We paint the rocks with love and spread them out, hoping to spread that love to others around us when they need it most.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Annual mammograms can detect cancer early, at its most treatable stage.

Diabetes results when there is too much glucose in your blood stream.</p><p>Sugar can be dangerous &mdash; for those with diabetes and for those who don&rsquo;t know they are at risk. Many of us watch what we eat, but few of us know how much hidden sugar is in everyday items such as soft drinks, candy, pastries and canned fruit. We all know there is sugar in the candy we crave, but did you know that ketchup is high in sugar?</p><p>Researchers at Emory University found that participants consumed an extra 320 calories in added sugars throughout any given day. Those extra calories can really add up and contribute to higher rates of obesity and diabetes.</p><p>Some foods are misleading. You wouldn&rsquo;t think that foods that have been deemed &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; would contain ingredients that could be harmful to your health or ruin your diet.</p><p>Here are some foods that include sneaky amounts of sugar:</p><ul><li>Bottled spaghetti sauce &ndash; some types of spaghetti sauce have as much as three times the amount of sugar as other sauces.</li><li>Breakfast cereals and bars &ndash; we all know that certain types of cereal have high amounts of sugar, but some &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; cereals such as Frosted Mini Wheats also pack a sugary punch.</li><li>Sugary beverages &ndash; soda, juice, smoothies, energy drinks and flavored milks can pack a surprising amount of sugar into those small bottles. Limiting these beverages can help your glucose levels as well as maintain your waistline. A 12-ounce can of regular soda has about 160 calories, or about 10 teaspoons of sugar.</li><li>Packaged fruits &ndash; fruits that are preserved in heavy or light syrup can contain up to 30 grams of sugar in an individual package. A good alternative is fresh fruit as opposed to packaged fruit.</li></ul><p><strong>Diabetes Type 1 and Type 2</strong><br>In Type 1 diabetes, the immune system begins to attack and destroy your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Because of the lack of insulin, glucose builds up in your bloodstream instead of being transported to your cells &ndash; where it serves as fuel for many bodily functions.</p><p>While the causes of Type 1 diabetes are still unknown, scientists believe that genetics and environmental factors play a role in developing the disease.</p><p>In Type 2 diabetes, the body does not produce enough insulin or the cells become resistant to the action of insulin and sugar build up in the bloodstream. Your body becomes unable to regulate blood glucose levels. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. It affects about 30 million people in the U.S., and 1.4 million people are diagnosed with diabetes every year.</p><p>Many people have prediabetes &ndash; blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough for a diabetes diagnosis. People with prediabetes can prevent or delay a diagnosis of diabetes by following a diet and exercise plan to reduce excess weight and keep blood glucose stable.</p><p>Attend a free nutrition talk at a <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/y-healthy-living-centers\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Y Healthy Living Center</a>.

Eaten a half-dozen doughnuts this morning? What do you even do about that?</p><p>There&rsquo;s a stigma surrounding mental health that often prevents people from getting care, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-stacy-quinn-do\" target=\"_blank\">Stacy Quinn, DO</a>, a family physician at Baptist Primary Care in Orange Park.</p><p>&ldquo;A lot of people think this is something they should just be able to do for themselves,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;People often believe it&rsquo;s caused by a decision they&rsquo;ve made.&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s common in cases like post traumatic stress disorder, depression or anxiety. But these mental health problems can actually be hard to overcome.</p><p>A mental health provider can help by offering a different perspective on things, Dr. Quinn said. Consider, for example, how typical it is for people who&rsquo;ve been abused to blame themselves.</p><p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t just make a decision to think differently. They need some help,&rdquo; Dr. Quinn said.</p><p>It may not seem obvious, but a primary care physician is one of the best places to begin the search for a mental health provider. Primary care physicians are trained to evaluate the mental health status of their patients and give a referral. They can assess whether a person needs medical treatment from a psychiatrist, or therapy from a qualified psychologist.</p><p>They&rsquo;re also trained to look for physical conditions that impact mental health, such as low blood count, over- or under-active thyroid, or hormones. And, they can identify contributing factors, such as the need for dietary changes, exercise, or adequate sleep.</p><p>You should ask your doctor about therapy if you&rsquo;re experiencing:</p><ul><li>Thoughts of harming yourself or someone else</li><li>Withdrawal from normal activities</li><li>Over- or under-eating</li><li>Changes in sleep patterns</li><li>Mood swings, becoming more emotional, or having difficulty expressing emotions</li></ul><p>Finding the therapist who&rsquo;s just right for you might mean shopping around.</p><p>You can narrow your search by asking whether a therapist is experienced in treating the issue you&rsquo;d like to address, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-devon-patterson-phd\" target=\"_blank\">De&rsquo;Von Patterson, PhD</a>, a licensed psychologist with Baptist Behavioral Health at the Baptist Clay Medical Campus. Clinicians often develop specialties in areas like trauma, family counseling, depression, anxiety, substance abuse and alcoholism.</p><p>You might also consider whether a therapist&rsquo;s approach sounds like a fit for you, Dr. Patterson said. Do you want a behavioral approach, which focuses not just on thoughts and emotions, but also on your behavior outside of the sessions? Or are you looking for a supportive approach, which offers a place to talk, reflect and develop a non-judgmental relationship with someone.</p><p>When you meet with a therapist, try to be aware of how it feels to be with him or her, Dr. Patterson said.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Can you imagine talking to this person about sensitive things?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Focus on how at ease you are by the end of the session because, at the beginning of the session, everyone is nervous.&rdquo;</p><p>Your therapist and you should discuss what your expectations are up front and how you both will measure progress. Then later, if a therapist isn&rsquo;t syncing up with what you need, have a conversation about what you&rsquo;d like him to do differently.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve done your best and you&rsquo;re just not getting any relief, try someone else, Dr. Patterson said. A clinician is not going to take it personally.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Fit is important. A good fit is most of what makes therapy work,&rdquo; Dr. Patterson said. &ldquo;My main goal is always to help a person, even if it&rsquo;s not always me that does it.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you or someone you know needs help with a mental health issue, and you need a primary care provider, visit <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">baptisjax.com/bpc</a> to find a doctor near you.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Like most two-year-olds, Henry Dyer is a busy toddler, zipping around the house while keeping his parents on their toes. But just a few short years ago, things were much different.</p><p>That&rsquo;s because Henry&rsquo;s little heart was starting to fail.</p><p>As he rounds the corner of the couch with lightning speed, his mom Bobbie Dyer can&rsquo;t help but think about another corner he turned, thanks to the collaborative care he received from his pediatric cardiology team at <a href=\"https://www.tmh.org/services/children/wolfson-childrens-specialty-center-at-tallahassee-memorial-healthcare\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Specialty Center at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare</a> (TMH) and at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Jacksonville.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing so well,&rdquo; said Dyer. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a huge difference now in his energy level and his playfulness.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The heart of the matter&nbsp;</strong></p><p>After Henry was born at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, he passed all of his newborn screenings, and was able to go home with his excited family just a few days later. What no one knew at the time, however, was that Henry had a hard-to-detect heart condition called an atrial septal defect (ASD) that&rsquo;s not usually discovered until months or years later when a doctor hears a murmur during a check-up.</p><p>About 2,000 babies are born each year in the U.S. with an ASD, which is a spot in the heart where the wall dividing the upper chambers hasn&rsquo;t finished forming. ASDs are very difficult to detect in newborns because ASD-related murmurs are quieter than those caused by other types of heart conditions. In Henry&rsquo;s case, it was found after about a month.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I took him to his pediatrician who heard the murmur,&rdquo; recalled Dyer. &ldquo;We were then told that Henry needed to see a specialist.&rdquo;</p><p>The Dyers took Henry to the office of Tallahassee pediatric cardiologists Drs. <a href=\"https://www.tmh.org/physician-directory/s/st-petery-louis-b\" target=\"_blank\">Louis St. Petery&nbsp;</a>and <a href=\"https://www.tmh.org/physician-directory/v/vining-justin-m\" target=\"_blank\">Justin &quot;Mac&quot; Vining</a>, who conducted several tests and confirmed the problem.</p><p>Because surgical outcomes are better when babies are given the chance to get a little bigger and stronger before major surgery, Dr. Vining elected to hold off for a little while and keep a close eye on Henry. But as he neared his first birthday, Henry began getting upper respiratory infections every month and was losing weight. Both were soon traced to a surprising decline in his heart function.</p><p>&ldquo;His rapid progression to congestive heart failure was atypical in a child with ASD,&rdquo; said Dr. Vining. &ldquo;Typically, even large ASDs don&rsquo;t present a problem until the age of 4 or 5, which is a common age for children to undergo the surgery that Henry needed much sooner. Even then, only a small percentage of these patients require medications to control congestive heart failure.&rdquo;</p><p>Henry was put on the medications to try to delay surgery but after about eight months, the need to do more came. With his blood recirculating through his lungs instead of supplying oxygenated blood to the rest of his body, his surgery was scheduled at the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/heart\" target=\"_blank\">C. Herman and Mary Virginia Terry Heart Center</a> at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital the November after he was born.</p><p>Terry Heart Center pediatric cardiovascular surgeons <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-cardiothoracic-surgeon/dr-michael-shillingford-md\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Shillingford, MD</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-cardiothoracic-surgeon/dr-eric-ceithaml-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Ceithaml, MD</a>, explained to the Dyers what was going to happen before Henry went back.</p><p>&ldquo;I kept cool in front of the doctors but once they went back to perform his surgery, I fell apart,&rdquo; said Dyer. &ldquo;That was my baby, and it was very scary.&rdquo;</p><p>Henry did well, however, and was soon recovering in the Cardiovascular ICU. Two weeks later, he got to go home, just in time for Thanksgiving.</p><p><strong>Care in the heart of Tallahassee</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Henry has bounced back so quickly!&rdquo; said Dyer. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s put on five pounds since his surgery, and his little scar is healing nicely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;His symptoms of congestive heart failure have resolved, and we have been able to stop his heart medications,&rdquo; said Dr. Vining. &ldquo;His long-term prognosis is excellent, and functionally, his heart is normal.&rdquo;</p><p>Henry&rsquo;s follow-up appointments will include electrocardiogram and echocardiogram testing to check his heart function, which he&rsquo;ll be able have done right in Tallahassee. That&rsquo;s a huge convenience for families like the Dyers.</p><p>The partnership between TMH and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital was designed to expand specialized pediatric health care into the Tallahassee area.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;This partnership is ideal for our patients because expanding the care available from pediatric cardiologists who live and practice locally improves patient care tremendously,&rdquo; said Dr. Vining. &ldquo;Pediatric cardiology has laid the foundation in this area. Adding more pediatric specialists to Tallahassee will continue to bring much needed care to children of our area.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>For little Henry Dyer, that means more time to run his parents ragged as he races past them through the house.</p><p>Find out more about congenital heart disease, our children&rsquo;s heart specialists at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, and the services offered by the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Specialty Center at <a href=\"https://www.tmh.org/services/children/wolfson-childrens-specialty-center-at-tallahassee-memorial-healthcare\" target=\"_blank\">tmh.org/Wolfson</a>.</p>",

This temporary pause in breathing causes people to wake many times during the night. A <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/sleep-centers\">sleep study</a> can determine if this is happening, and if needed, a C-PAP machine can help regulate breathing.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, people don&rsquo;t need less sleep as they age. In fact, the recommended amount throughout adulthood doesn&rsquo;t change &ndash; seven to nine hours. But adults over 65 have a harder time remaining asleep throughout the night. They experience less &ldquo;REM&rdquo; or deep sleep, which often leads to frequent waking through the night.</p><p>For those who experience anxiety while trying to fall asleep, cognitive behavioral therapy may help. This program is available at Baptist&rsquo;s AgeWell Center for Senior Health and helps patients replace thoughts and behaviors that prevent sleep with those that promote sound sleep.</p><p>Dr. Issa is reluctant to prescribe medications for insomnia, opting for non-drug treatments first.</p><p>&ldquo;Medication is not a cure for insomnia,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If a prescription is temporarily needed, I avoid benzodiazepines (like Xanax) for any longer than two weeks because they are habit-forming and can cause falls, accidents and memory impairment. &nbsp;An antidepressant, such as trazadone, is safer, and an even better option is a natural sleep aid like melatonin.&rdquo; (Remember not to drive or operate machinery for four to five hours after taking any type of sleep aid.)</p><p>After ruling out underlying medical issues, Dr. Issa recommends improving your sleep &ldquo;hygiene&rdquo; &ndash; the daily habits you have when preparing for bed. Some tips (for any age) include:</p><ol><li>Implement pre-sleep rituals. Doing the same activities each night, like reading, bathing or having a light snack can help your body transition to sleep.</li><li>Try to go to bed at the same time every night.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t drink caffeine within six hours of bedtime.</li><li>Avoid alcohol and large meals before bedtime.</li><li>Avoid screen time. The light from a phone, TV or any electronic device can suppress the production of sleep regulating hormones.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t take naps during the day.</li><li>Keep your bedroom dark, cool and quiet as possible.</li><li>Limit your beverages in the evenings to avoid bathroom trips.</li><li>Use your bedroom for sleeping only.</li><li>If you can&rsquo;t fall asleep after about 20 minutes, get out of bed and try again after you start to feel sleepy.</li></ol><p>Some patients benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Women experience changes in their bodies throughout their entire lives. Some of these changes are due to aging. Others are the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy, menopause, or menstrual cycles.</p><p>While it may feel awkward to mention unusual symptoms in &ldquo;unmentionable&rdquo; places to your doctor, these changes often provide important clues to your health. If you notice any unusual changes in your body, talk with your doctor to make sure that what you&rsquo;re experiencing isn&rsquo;t serious.</p><p>Every woman is different, so it&rsquo;s important to know what is normal for you so you can recognize changes that may signal a possible health problem. Here are a few gynecological symptoms you should not ignore.</p><ul><li><strong>Pelvic or abdominal pain</strong>. Only about 20 percent of pelvic pain women experience is actually due to gynecological problems, such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Musculoskeletal conditions and urinary or bowel problems can also cause pelvic pain.</li><li><strong>Abnormal vaginal discharge</strong>. All women have vaginal discharge. It&rsquo;s nature&rsquo;s way of keeping your genital area clean and healthy. Normal discharge is white or clear, with little or no odor. If your vaginal discharge changes in color, amount or consistency, or it takes on a noticeable odor, see your doctor.</li><li><strong>Breast changes</strong>. Worrisome breast symptoms include a change in size or shape of the breast, skin changes on the breast, a lump, or changes in the nipple (including discharge). The symptoms of breast cancer and less serious breast problems are similar. In fact, only 20 percent of breast lumps are due to cancer, so don&rsquo;t let fear of a cancer diagnosis keep you from discussing any breast changes with your doctor.</li><li><strong>Abnormal vaginal bleeding</strong>. See your doctor if you experience heavy bleeding that lasts longer than normal, occurs more frequently than every three weeks, after sex, or between periods. You should also pay attention to spotting or bleeding in between periods.</li><li><strong>Pain during sexual intercour</strong><strong>se</strong>. Don&rsquo;t be embarrassed. According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, nearly three-quarters of women will experience pain during sex at some point in their lives, particularly after menopause.</li><li><strong>Difficult or painful urination, excessive chronic bloating, or painful periods.</strong></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Changes during menopause</strong></p><p>Menopause is the natural end to a woman&rsquo;s childbearing years. You are in menopause after completing 12 months without a period. For some women, this transition is uneventful. However, up to 40 percent of women experience one or more disruptive symptoms, including:</p><ul><li>Vaginal burning or itching</li><li>Decreased libido during sex</li><li>Painful intercourse</li><li>Bleeding after sex</li><li>More frequent vaginal or urinary tract infections</li><li>Frequent urination</li></ul><p><br></p><p>If you are a pre- or post-menopausal woman and are uncomfortable due to the changes in your body, talk to your doctor. There are many healthy ways to address menopausal symptoms. You should also see your doctor if you have any vaginal bleeding once your periods stop.</p><p><strong>Gynecological cancer screening</strong></p><p>Health experts agree that women should undergo regular screenings for cervical cancer. If you are at increased risk (for example, you have a family history of cancer), your doctor may recommend earlier or more frequent screening. The goal of screening is to find cancer early, when treatment is more effective. Women should undergo Pap tests for cervical cancer screening between the ages of 21 and 65 or between 30 and 65 in combination with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. Ask your doctor about the right screening test and frequency for you. Currently, there is no reliable screening for ovarian cancer. If you experience bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating, urinary changes (changes in urgency or frequency), or you find you feel full quickly after eating, see your doctor to rule out ovarian cancer.</p><p><strong>Pelvic Health</strong></p><p>Some of the symptoms women experience are related to a weakened pelvic floor. Baptist Health offers a program called Total Control&reg;, an evidence-based program and a no-medication, nonsurgical way to improve pelvic health. It helps women strengthen the &ldquo;pelvic pyramid&rdquo; &ndash; which includes the pelvic floor muscles, lower back muscles and abdominal muscles.</p><p><strong>Action Items:</strong></p><p>Learn what is normal for YOU so you can recognize new or unusual symptoms and visit your doctor with any concerns. Make sure you keep track of any recommended screenings and annual visits.</p><p><em>Baptist Health offers a collection of wellness services, focused on women.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>There were no symptoms. Just a persistent cough that could have been caused by sinus drainage. But Pamela Francis was 68, and she had smoked since she was a teenager. Her family doctor of 30 years knew she was a good candidate for a new lung scan that could detect early-stage cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>James Clower, MD, who today is chief medical officer for Baptist Primary Care, told Francis in 2016 during her annual checkup, &ldquo;Pam, your insurance will pay for the test, and I think you need to have it.&rdquo; She put it off, and he called to remind her.</p><p>When she finally got it, it saved her life.</p><p>Doctors found a stage 1B tumor between the middle and upper lobes of her right lung. She underwent surgery to remove it with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/thoracic-surgeon/dr-joe-putnam-jr-md\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Putnam, MD</a>, thoracic surgeon and Medical Director at Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center, and four cycles of chemotherapy followed.</p><p>No longer a smoker, Francis is now cancer-free.</p><p><strong>Who should get screened?</strong></p><p>The United States Preventive Services Task Force began recommending in 2013 that certain people at high risk for lung cancer have yearly screening with low-dose CT scans. But smokers have been reluctant. &nbsp;Less than 5.9 percent of people who are eligible for the screening get it, according to research presented at this year&rsquo;s American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting.</p><p>&ldquo;There is a stigma associated with smoking that makes people avoid this,&rdquo; said Carolyn Baggett, RN, the lung cancer screening program coordinator at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>. &ldquo;People feel like they&rsquo;ve done it to themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>The truth is, smoking is an addiction and no one deserves lung cancer, Baggett said.</p><p>&ldquo;They deserve compassion, and we are here to offer support,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><strong>A smoker&rsquo;s nagging guilt</strong></p><p>Francis began smoking in the 1960s, back when nearly everybody smoked.</p><p>&ldquo;I worked in a hospital in the admitting office. In those days, you could smoke at a hospital,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You could actually smoke at your desk. It wasn&rsquo;t unusual.&rdquo;</p><p>One time, she quit. But it didn&rsquo;t stick.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew I should stop, but I didn&rsquo;t dwell on it,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>She did feel guilty, though, when she worked with patients and told them not to smoke. And, there was one person in her life who continued to pester her about her smoking.</p><p>Dr. Clower was Francis&rsquo;s family physician, but he was also her boss and her friend. He was bothered by his nurse&rsquo;s one smoking. &nbsp;&ldquo;In spite of all my nagging for her to quit, it never worked for her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a drug-delivery system for nicotine and is very addictive.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size4of4\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1543440277/Juice/pamela-francis-016.jpg\" alt=\"Doctor and patient talking\"></div><p>Francis said with a laugh &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t harp on it. But when he had an opportunity, there would be this little dig.&rdquo;</p><p>When Dr. Clower suggested Francis get the lung scan, she was reluctant. But then, she got it done. She received a phone call within hours. The result was positive.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re in disbelief,&rdquo; Francis said. &ldquo;I knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to be good.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Screening, a game changer for survival</strong></p><p>Because her tumor was detected early, though, the news wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it could have been. Her successful treatment and survival has made her a lung screening fan, and she now recommends the test to others with long histories of smoking.</p><p>Baggett wishes more people would get the scan. By the time symptoms appear, lung cancer has typically advanced to stage 4. It&rsquo;s a heartbreaking moment for patients and loved ones. The conversations turn to keeping the patient alive long enough to share a few more family milestones.</p><p>The five-year survival rate for stage 4 lung cancer is 5 percent. But if the cancer is discovered early, while it&rsquo;s still localized in the lungs, the survival rate increases to 70 percent.</p><p>Baggett said the vast majority of patients she saw during her years as a lung cancer nurse navigator typically had stage 4 cancers. It was very rare to see a patient at stage 1.</p><p>Today, she&rsquo;s seeing something different. In 2015 Baggett led the launch of Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center&rsquo;s new low-dose CT scan program. Since then, 70 percent of lung cancers discovered through the program have been stage 1 or 2.</p><p>&ldquo;It excites me to see we&rsquo;re finding so many at an early stage,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It means this is working and more people will survive lung cancer.&rdquo;</p><p>The lung cancer team that is a critical part of this effort includes Dr. Putnam; Subrato Deb, MD, thoracic surgeon; Aakash Modi, MD, interventional pulmonologist; <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/medical-oncologist/dr-john-vu-md\" target=\"_blank\">John Vu, MD</a>, medical oncologist; <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/radiation-oncologist/dr-michael-olson-md\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Olson, MD</a>, radiation oncologist; as well as Carolyn Baggett, RN and Isis Leonard, RN.</p><p>Low-dose CT scans are recommended for adults aged 55 to 77 years who have a &ldquo;30 pack-year&rdquo; smoking history and who currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Thirty pack-years means a person has smoked a pack a day for 30 years, or two packs a day for 15 years.</p><p><em>To find out if you are eligible to be tested, contact your primary care physician or visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center/lung-and-chest-cancer/screening-form\" target=\"_blank\"><em>baptistjax.com/lungscreening</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

And getting healthy can be easier when you do it as a couple.</p><p>Here are some tips on how to encourage healthy habits, and a timely check-up, for those closest to you:</p><ol><li><strong>Plan healthy meals for the whole family.</strong> Make it a collective effort, and include yourself in the healthy eating. Transition to meals prepared at home as opposed to eating out all the time. Choose meals from a Mediterranean-based diet that is rich in lean protein and vegetables.</li><li><strong>Encourage your partner to come along on walks and outdoor activities</strong>. No time to exercise? Divide exercise time into small chunks.</li><li><strong>Know your numbers</strong>. An annual check-up with a primary care doctor can give you important information about your blood pressure levels, your cholesterol, blood sugar and body mass index.</li><li><strong>Make essential health benefits work for you</strong>. Do you have an opportunity for an annual checkup or a health screening through existing insurance? Use the benefit and encourage him to use it as well.</li><li><strong>Get screened for heart disease and cancer</strong>. Ask a primary care doctor about the right screening for your age and risk factors.</li><li><strong>Make healthy weight a priority</strong>. Enlist the help of a primary care doctor and/or wellness coach to get to your ideal weight. Challenge each other to stick to the plan.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Taper off on the drinks</strong>. If you drink more than one glass of wine or one beer daily, cut back on your alcohol intake. It puts you at risk of disease and it messes up your diet.</li><li><strong>Quit smoking.&nbsp;</strong>Tobacco products of any kind increase your risk of heart attack, stroke and cancer. Help your loved one find help to quit.</li><li><strong>Seek help for depression</strong>. If you or a loved one shows signs of depression, find help. Mental wellness is as important as physical well-being.</li><li><strong>Make time to pause on your busy paths and enjoy the simple things</strong>.</li></ol><p>The same way in which you do scheduled maintenance or your car, do maintenance on your body. Keep that annual physical appointment, follow up on your doctor&rsquo;s recommendations and ask the people closest to you to do the same.</p><p>Good habits are contagious. By setting the example for your partner, you start to move the needle on setting healthy patterns that will benefit everyone at home.</p><p><em>For a free biometric screening, personal health survey, and a session with a coach, visit the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/y-healthy-living-centers\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Y Healthy Living Center</a>s.</em></p><p><em>Our guest columnist is <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-francisco-martinez-wittinghan-md\" target=\"_blank\">Francisco Martinez-Wittinghan, MD, PhD</a>, with <a href=\"http://www.baptistjax.com/bpc\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a> in Nocatee.

With so much conflicting health information these days, it&rsquo;s hard to know what to believe when it comes to your heart.</p><p>Here are some common questions I get from my patients. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>What type of diet is healthiest?</strong><br>I believe that nutrition is the single most important factor in reducing your heart disease risk.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1522247522/Juice/Mediterranean_Diet_infographicJuice.jpg\" alt=\"Mediterranean Diet infographic\"></div><p>Stick to foods that are low in cholesterol, saturated fat and high in fiber. I am a big proponent of the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/wellness/how-to-quiet-that-smoldering-fire-inside-you\">Mediterranean Diet,&nbsp;</a>which is full of &ldquo;superfoods,&rdquo; like berries, broccoli and almonds, all of which are high in heart-healthy nutrients.</p><p>Most of your food should come from fruits, vegetables and complex carbohydrates like quinoa (pronounced &ldquo;keen-wa&rdquo;), brown rice and whole oats. For protein, fish and seafood are best, followed by poultry, eggs and cheese.</p><p>Maintaining this type of diet decreases your cholesterol and blood pressure and also helps you drop extra weight &ndash; all important factors for a healthy heart. And fresh foods actually taste better, so you&rsquo;re more satisfied and less likely to add unnecessary salt and sugar.</p><p><strong>Are vitamins and supplements a good idea?</strong><br>Unless you have a vitamin deficiency, you should get your vitamins from whole, fresh foods rather than supplements. These foods contain micronutrients your body needs, along with fiber and antioxidants.</p><p><strong>Is coconut oil good for your heart?</strong><br>Coconut oil is about 80 percent saturated fat, which increases your cholesterol, so I recommend you don&rsquo;t ingest it. Instead, eat mono-unsaturated fats like avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil. They all have cardio-protective properties, meaning they protect your heart from disease.</p><p><strong>Is it true that red wine is good for your heart?</strong><br>I would never recommend that someone start drinking to improve heart health because too much wine -- more than one glass per day -- can actually weaken your heart over time. For those who drink, moderate amounts of red wine can be beneficial. It can increase your HDL, or &ldquo;good&rdquo; cholesterol, and contains antioxidants, which can reduce inflammation in your body. Red wine also contains resveratrol, which is theorized to have cardio-protective properties. For non-drinkers, keep in mind that the same you can get the same benefits from red grapes.</p><p><strong>I&rsquo;ve heard the term &ldquo;inflammation&rdquo; related to heart disease lately. What is it?</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/wellness/how-to-quiet-that-smoldering-fire-inside-you\"><span style='font-family: \"Fauna One\", serif; font-size: 1.125em; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; background-color: initial; text-align: initial;'>Inflammation</span></a><span style='font-family: \"Fauna One\", serif; font-size: 1.125em; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; background-color: initial; text-align: initial;'>&nbsp;is at the root of almost every chronic disease, including heart disease. It&rsquo;s your body&rsquo;s reaction to an infection or injury, and can also be caused by stress. Your diet can help reduce inflammation greatly. The biggest culprits are simple carbs and sugar, so sticking to the Mediterranean Diet is a good way to reduce inflammation.</span></p><p>I tell my patients to avoid any food that comes in a box or bag, because they usually contain high amounts of sodium and artificial ingredients, which can lead to inflammation. It&rsquo;s best to &ldquo;shop the perimeter&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re at the grocery store where you&rsquo;ll find fresh, rather than processed foods. &nbsp;</p><div class=\"u-size1of4 u-floatRight u-spaceLeft05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1537395080/Juice/houston-mooney-md-8x10.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Mooney\"></div><p><strong>Is it a good idea to take an aspirin a day?</strong><br>The decision to take aspirin should be one you make with advice from your doctor. Aspirin is well established in helping prevent a second heart attack or stroke. However, recent studies suggest that aspirin does not prevent a primary heart condition. It has also been suggested that aspirin can lower your risk of colon cancer. Again, be sure to check with your physician before you decide whether taking aspirin daily is right for you.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-john-mooney-md\"><em>Houston Mooney, MD, i</em></a><em>s a board-certified clinical cardiologist with Baptist Medical Center Nassau.

He was treated by pediatric neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-neurosurgeon/dr-alexandra-beier-do\" target=\"_blank\">Alexandra Beier, DO,</a> University of Florida College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville, and endovascular neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-ricardo-hanel-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ricardo Hanel, MD, PhD,</a> with Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville, Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/lyerly-neurosurgery\" target=\"_blank\">Lyerly Neurosurgery</a>, and who serves as director of the Baptist Neurological Institute.</p><p>&ldquo;When Dr. Hanel told me that Jaydon would be the first pediatric patient to ever have this procedure, I was nervous and scared, but I also knew Jaydon was in the best care possible,&rdquo; said Stephanie Porter, Jaydon&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How it all started</strong></p><p>The day that Jaydon had the procedure started out as a typical day. He had attended school and enjoyed his usual family routine when he returned home. Porter tucked him into bed that night. A short time later, she heard him coughing and went into his bedroom to check on him. Immediately upon seeing him, Jaydon&rsquo;s mom knew something was terribly wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to make sure he was okay,&rdquo; Porter said. &ldquo;But Jaydon was lifeless, and we couldn&rsquo;t wake him up.&rdquo;</p><p>Porter called 911, and Jaydon was transported to a hospital near his home. After he was examined, a CT scan confirmed Jaydon had bleeding in his brain, a subarachnoid hemorrhage, that was not allowing his spinal fluid to drain properly.&nbsp;</p><p>He was taken by helicopter to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and prepped for emergency brain surgery to drain his spinal fluid and then further imaging revealed he had a ruptured aneurysm. This was then treated endovascularly with the Pipeline Embolization Device.</p><p>A cerebral aneurysm is a weak or thin spot on a blood vessel in the brain that balloons out and fills with blood. Though brain aneurysms are very rare among children, they can be extremely serious. In Jaydon&rsquo;s case, he had no family history of aneurysms. His aneurysm developed as a result of an abnormality in the blood vessel wall. The aneurysm was located toward the back of Jaydon&rsquo;s brain near the brain stem, and it bled. If an aneurysm ruptures and causes bleeding in the brain, it requires immediate medical attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Jaydon was deteriorating quickly due to hydrocephalus (fluid on the brain) that we were able to treat with an external drain,&rdquo; said Dr. Beier. &ldquo;He had a ruptured aneurysm that Dr. Hanel was able to treat successfully with the Pipeline procedure. We were very fortunate to have Dr. Hanel on this case. He and his partner, endovascular neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-eric-sauvageau-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Sauvageau, MD,</a> were co-authors and co-investigators on a Pipeline study that was published last year. The study showed the benefit of using the Pipeline device to treat smaller aneurysms.&rdquo;</p><p>The results of the study, presented at the International Stroke Conference in Houston, showed that a cylindrical Pipeline device used to treat large brain aneurysms is just as effective on smaller and sometimes hard-to-reach aneurysms. The Pipeline device is a specialized stent that is implanted in the brain to slow the flow of blood, preventing the aneurysm from growing and allowing it to heal. It is inserted through a microcatheter into an artery in the groin and then threaded through the body to the brain. After the stent is placed, the embolization will naturally shrink the aneurysm over time.</p><p>&ldquo;The Pipeline Embolization Device is a safe and effective way of dealing with brain aneurysms,&rdquo; Dr. Hanel said. &ldquo;We have one of the largest experiences in the country with flow diverter devices for pediatric patients. The good thing about the Pipeline device is that once the aneurysm is closed off and treated, the patient is cured, which is very empowering.&rdquo;</p><p>Jaydon spent two-and-a-half weeks on the Pediatric Intensive Care and Neuroscience units at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. Six months later, diagnostic imaging confirmed the aneurysm was gone.</p><p>&ldquo;Today, Jaydon is a perfectly fine six-year-old boy and you wouldn&rsquo;t know that he had experienced this condition,&rdquo; Porter said. &ldquo;I am so thankful for Dr. Beier and Dr. Hanel, and for everyone at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.&quot;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>St. Johns County resident Riley Theis is an adult now, planning for her future. She doesn&rsquo;t think much about what happened to her when she was 12. But if she forgets, she&rsquo;s got a reminder: a fading scar hidden under the hairline, all that remains of the fight of her life.</p><p>&ldquo;I was in sixth grade, and I remember I had headaches every day for four months,&rdquo; said Theis, now 23. &ldquo;I would wake up with a headache, eat breakfast, throw up to relieve the pressure in my head and then go to school and be fine until the end of the day. I&rsquo;d come home with a headache and either sleep the entire evening or try to take something for the pain. We thought the headaches were associated with me getting contacts.&rdquo;</p><p>On Mother&rsquo;s Day in 2007, Theis and her mom were in Jacksonville shopping. &ldquo;My mom said, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re near a hospital. Let&rsquo;s just pop into the ER,&rsquo;&rdquo; recalled Theis. &ldquo;They did a CT scan and found a mass the size of a golf ball. I was transported to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, which started my journey.&rdquo;</p><p>After being diagnosed with a brain tumor, Theis was scheduled for surgery with UF College of Medicine -- Jacksonville pediatric neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-neurosurgeon/dr-philipp-aldana-md\" target=\"_blank\">Philipp Aldana, MD</a>, now co-medical director of the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/brain/brain-and-spine-tumors\" target=\"_blank\">Stys Neuroscience Institute at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s</a>.</p><p>While she recovered from her nine-hour brain surgery in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, her parents were presented with two options: for Theis to have chemo and radiation, or to be enrolled in a study where she would be very closely monitored. &ldquo;They decided they didn&rsquo;t want me going through chemo and radiation so I was enrolled into the study,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Because her parents were positive and calm from the time of diagnosis through treatment, Theis was never scared. In fact, she embraced her experience.</p><p>&ldquo;I love that I had a tumor,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not many people can say they had a brain tumor. That&rsquo;s what makes me special and unique. I love my scar. It&rsquo;s probably a good five inches and in the shape of an &lsquo;S.&rsquo; I say it&rsquo;s an S for &quot;Survivor.&quot; I have always loved showing off my battle wounds.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Her brain tumor returns</strong></p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 2010, when she was a freshman in high school, that an MRI scan that was part of the study she was enrolled in revealed a small spot in Theis&rsquo;s brain, a recurring tumor.</p><p>Dr. Aldana said, &ldquo;The tumor that returned was about the size of a BB. I was able to remove this with an endoscope. However, because it returned, it was likely that there could be other tumors that would develop. To reduce this risk, I referred Riley for proton radiation therapy, which is safer than conventional photon radiation therapy.&rdquo;</p><p>Following brain surgery with Dr. Aldana to remove the tumor, Theis went through six weeks of targeted radiation therapy at the UF Health Proton Therapy Institute in Jacksonville, and is now cancer-free.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I feel like I didn&rsquo;t really have cancer sometimes, and that I had an easy way out,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Even with radiation treatments, I had no side effects because the dosage was so low. My whole treatment experience was so picture-perfect.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Childhood experience influences her career choice</strong></p><p>Inspired by the caregivers at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, especially Dr. Aldana and neurosurgery nurse practitioner Teresa MacGregor, ARNP, Theis decided to go into health care. &ldquo;Teresa was the first person I knew of who wasn&rsquo;t a doctor but still gets to have a say in treatment plans for patients,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t necessarily want to be a doctor. She helped shape my thinking of wanting to be a physician assistant (PA) instead.&rdquo;</p><p>Theis has already started her health care career, currently working as a certified nursing assistant in the Critical Care Unit at Baptist Medical Center Beaches. &ldquo;I thought it would give me great experience overall and I would get to see the doctor&rsquo;s side and the nursing side,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It has helped me gain even more of a respect for what nurses do and I have gotten to develop way more skills than what I was even expecting.&quot;</p><p>Theis is hoping to begin the next part of her journey, and is interviewing with colleges to work toward her goal of being a PA. She homes to focus on pediatrics like her role models.</p><p>And she knows she&rsquo;ll have a great story to share with her future patients. And she can share something else: the surgical scar no one can see unless she shows it to them because Dr. Aldana so carefully hid the incision beneath her hair, over her right ear.</p><p>Theis, who would like to work with children with cancer when she becomes a PA, said she wouldn&rsquo;t mind showing future patients her scar if it gives them hope.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I feel like it&rsquo;s a reminder that even though I went through a hard time, one experience does not define my whole life. And if anything, it proves that I have the strength to get through anything. It&rsquo;s a sign of hope for me, that the tumor was not the end, that I did survive. I would hope by me showing off my scar, kids would find hope that their cancer experience is not what defines them and that there can be life after cancer. You just have to be positive and push through.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Aldana said he and his team are impressed by how Theis has turned her experience into a positive. &ldquo;It is wonderful to see that Riley is a thriving brain tumor survivor who wants to use her experience to help heal others,&rdquo; he said.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Every September, people living with sickle cell disease join the health care community in observing Sickle Cell Awareness Month.</p><p>With proper treatment, people living with sickle cell disease can enjoy a high quality of life. Blood donors with a specific red blood cell antigen profile play a critical role in the long-term treatment of sickle cell disease.</p><p><strong>What is sickle cell disease?</strong><br>Sickle cell disease is the common name for sickle cell anemia. The disease is passed down through families. It primarily affects people of African and Mediterranean descent; though it is also common among people from South and Central America, the Caribbean and the Middle East. Approximately one in every 365 African-American children is born with sickle cell disease.</p><p>Sickle cell disease is named for the thin, crescent-shaped red blood cells that face more difficulty passing through blood vessels than healthy, disc-shaped red blood cells. Common sickle cell disease symptoms include:</p><ul><li>Fatigue</li><li>Swelling joints, hands, and feet</li><li>Breathlessness</li><li>Rapid heart rate</li><li>Acute pain crises</li><li>Yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)</li><li>Paleness</li></ul><p>People living with sickle cell disease also have an increased risk of complications, including stroke, liver disease, and delayed growth.</p><p><strong>How is sickle cell disease treated?</strong><br>Blood transfusions are among the most common treatments for sickle cell disease. Transfusions can help increase the amount of healthy red blood cells in the bloodstream and lessen the effects of the sickle-shaped cells.</p><p>The frequency of transfusions can vary from one patient to the next. Some patients living with sickle cell disease need transfusions as often as every four weeks. Each of these transfusion events, or red blood cell exchanges, can require six to eight units of red blood cells. To reduce the risk of complications, Baptist Health works with LifeSouth Community Blood Centers to pair patients with blood donors whose blood type is a precise match.</p><p>We call these special donors &ldquo;Sickle Cell Heroes&rdquo; because they provide the life-saving red blood cells patients need to lead full and healthy lives.</p><p><strong>Could you be a &ldquo;Sickle Cell Hero&rdquo;?</strong><br>The best transfusion matches are likely to be found within a patient&rsquo;s own ethnic group. LifeSouth tests donations from African-American donors to identify potential antigen profile matches. The organization is one of only a few blood centers in the United States to test large quantities of donors for the purpose of matching donors with patients living with sickle cell disease.</p><p>Here are three ways you can support your neighbors with sickle cell disease:</p><ul><li><strong>Visit a LifeSouth donor center</strong>. LifeSouth operates a donor center at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>, located at 800 Prudential Drive. The center is open Monday through Friday from 9 am to 4 pm, except for Wednesdays when hours are noon to 7 pm. LifeSouth will test each donation to identify potential donors with a matching blood type.</li><li><strong>Donate as often as you can if your blood antigen profile is a match</strong>. If you are identified as a &ldquo;Sickle Cell Hero,&rdquo; Baptist Health and LifeSouth may be able to link your donations with a local patient living with sickle cell disease.</li><li><strong>Join the <strong><a href=\"https://bethematch.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Be The Match</a><strong>&nbsp;Registry</strong></strong></strong>. LifeSouth can assist local donors who are interested in being potential bone marrow or cord blood donors for patients in need, including those living with sickle cell disease.</li></ul><p><em>Our guest columnist is Chris Lough, MD, vice president of Medical Services for LifeSouth Community Blood Centers.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Since its debut in 2015, the Apple Watch has made it easy for people to monitor and track their fitness, get notifications and perform other functions while freeing them from their cell phones.</p><p>Now, Apple has announced its new Series 4 watch, which offers new health sensors and apps that include a one-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor. Apple got clearance for the ECG app from the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Apple says the ECG capability can detect <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/heart-vascular-care/atrial-fibrillation-and-arrhythmia\" target=\"_blank\">atrial fibrillation</a> (also known as AFib), a disorder that causes the upper chambers of the heart to beat in a sporadic, rapid or uncontrolled manner. Not life-threatening on its own, the disorder should be treated to control symptoms and prevent future cardiovascular complications like stroke.</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-carlos-zamora-md\" target=\"_blank\">Carlos Zamora, MD</a>, a cardiologist with Baptist Heart Specialists, believes the new device could have some benefit for people with heart rhythm disorders, he stresses that it&rsquo;s not a diagnostic tool. While it can detect an irregular heartbeat, it can&rsquo;t tell whether it&rsquo;s AFib or just too much caffeine.</p><p>&ldquo;The greatest potential benefit of a wearable device like the new Apple watch is that you could potentially find out about more people who have undiagnosed heart rhythm conditions, which means they could be treated that much earlier,&rdquo; said Dr. Zamora. &ldquo;But it certainly doesn&rsquo;t trump a doctor&rsquo;s diagnosis and care.&rdquo;</p><p>Baptist Heart Specialists electrophysiologist <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiac-electrophysiologist/dr-aaditya-vora-md\" target=\"_blank\">Aaditya Vora, MD</a>, said he would like to see how the watch works for a little bit and what the real-life experiences are. While he finds the new technology&rsquo;s capabilities intriguing, he and Dr. Zamora are concerned the device could trigger false alarms.</p><p>&ldquo;This watch is naturally going to be attractive to younger, healthier, more tech-savvy people instead of the people who would benefit the most: those with a known condition like Afib, who tend to be older,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No matter what the device&rsquo;s results are, they will have to be confirmed by a physician. That means people who may really have no need to seek medical attention will be seeking it, and if things look uncertain, it will lead to more tests. We always want to be careful about overdiagnosing people with any kind of electrical heart condition like arrhythmia.&rdquo;</p><p>Still, both doctors are glad the new Apple Watch and other technology is bringing awareness to heart rhythm conditions such as AFib. &ldquo;Devices like this have exciting new capabilities for people who like to monitor their health on their own,&rdquo; said Dr. Vora. &ldquo;There are other apps out there that offer one-lead ECG capability, including one I recommend to some of my patients called Kardia. These apps are much less expensive than the new device, which has a starting price of $399 for the watch.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Zamora said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good technology but not everyone will have access to it, so it&rsquo;s good that people are aware of the symptoms of AFib so they stay in regular communication with their health care providers and get recommended check-ups.&quot;</p><p><em>If you are concerned you have an irregular heartbeat and need a cardiologist, or for more information about heart conditions, please visit <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">baptistjax.com/heart</a>.</em></p>",

To shine a spotlight on this important issue, hospitals and health care systems across the nation were called upon to address suicide risks in their patients.</p><p>&ldquo;In 2016, The Joint Commission asked all hospitals to come up with a standardized way to detect and screen suicide risk behaviors among patients , not just in a behavioral health setting, but in the entire patient population,&rdquo; said John Repique, DNP, RN, psychiatric nurse and system director of Inpatient <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Behavioral Health</a> for Baptist Health.</p><p>A study published in <em>The Joint Commission Journal of Quality and Patient Safety</em> in September 2018 also found that about 49 to 65 suicides occur in hospitals in the U.S. every year. While that&rsquo;s much lower than the old figure &mdash; an estimated 1,500 per year &mdash; Repique says that &ldquo;even one death by suicide is far too many.&rdquo;</p><p>In response, a team of clinical experts was assembled to decide the best way to screen every Baptist Health patient for suicide risk. Today, the result of their efforts is both simple and effective: a two-question suicide risk screening as part of the initial patient assessment at every visit to a Baptist Health emergency room, hospital or outpatient practice.</p><p>Two questions in the screening patients are asked are:</p><ol><li>Over the past two weeks, have you felt down, depressed or hopeless?</li><li>Over the past two weeks, have you wished you were dead or wished you would go to sleep and not wake up?</li></ol><p>&ldquo;We adopted a brief screening tool that is easy to use and evidence-informed,&rdquo; said Repique. &ldquo;With these questions, nurses throughout our health system can quickly screen all patients on their first clinical visit for potential depression symptoms and also suicide risk. If there is a positive response to this, it triggers a more comprehensive assessment. Then, if this assessment determines the individual is positive for being at risk for suicide, the system sends an automatic request for an evaluation by a Baptist Behavioral Health mental health professional as soon as possible,&rdquo; explained Repique.</p><p>Since December 2017, at least 114,000 patient screenings have been administered using the questionnaire. Repique says this assessment is a tool designed to keep patients safe and detect mental health concerns before they escalate or lead to a tragedy.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really addressing not just their physical needs. Oftentimes patients are coming to us about their physical health, but some folks may not know they&rsquo;re having mental health issues,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;With this brief assessment, we can quickly screen for depression symptoms conveniently during their other appointments. It picks up at-risk patients so we can intervene immediately, provide patients with education on the warning signs of suicide, connect them with mental health providers if appropriate and hopefully save a life.&rdquo;</p><p>While support is available for those with depression or suicidal thoughts, it can be hard to recognize when you should reach out for help. There are also certain factors that may put you at a higher risk for attempting suicide. You may be at risk if:</p><ul><li>You live with one or more mental health conditions, including depression, bipolar disorder and substance abuse.</li><li>You have made previous suicide attempts or have a family history of suicide.</li><li>You have physical health conditions that cause chronic pain.</li><li>You have access to lethal means, including firearms and drugs or medications.</li><li>You are experiencing stressful life events, including unemployment, harassment, divorce, financial crisis or loss.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><em>If you feel you might be at risk for suicide or experiencing depression, call the </em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Behavioral Health</em></a><em> 24-hour crisis line at 904.202.7900.

She had stage 4 cancer. Within days, doctors were talking to her about surgery, chemotherapy and proton radiation therapy. Her chances for survival were pegged at 30 percent.</p><p>She remembers words from her doctor that gave her hope:</p><p>&ldquo;Marissa is not a statistic. If you look at the statistics, then that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to get. But she is her own statistic,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-hematologist-oncologist/dr-eric-sandler-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Sandler, MD</a>, pediatric hematologist/oncologist at Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care.</p><p>Ierna beat the odds and has remained cancer-free for five years.</p><p>Thanks to major advances in childhood cancer treatment, there are even more kids who have hope these days. More than 80 percent of children with cancer now survive five years or more, according to the American Cancer Society. In the mid-1970s, the five-year survival rate was about 58 percent.</p><p><strong>Clinical trials drive progress</strong></p><p>The success is due to the large number of clinical trials that have become available to children, said <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-hematologist-oncologist/dr-howard-katzenstein-md\" target=\"_blank\">Howard Katzenstein, MD</a>, chief of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care and for Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;Pediatric represents 1 percent of all cancers, but 25 percent of all cancer patients treated on clinical trials,&rdquo; Dr. Katzenstein said. &ldquo;So, we learn things faster in kids. When a clinical trial is available, 85 percent of patients choose to go on it.&rdquo;</p><p>Fifty years ago when a child was diagnosed with leukemia, it was virtually a death sentence. Now, 90 percent of children survive the disease.</p><p>That gives hope to families too. Childhood cancer creates a huge impact, not just on a patient, but on everyone close to the child.</p><p><strong>Shared sacrifice</strong></p><p>Cori Cook survived a rare aggressive cancer as an infant and barely remembers it. But the scars on her back and chest bear witness to the tubes inserted as part of her treatment and the surgery which removed her tumor.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Cook is a nurse who works on the pediatric oncology floor at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. When she sees what families go through&mdash;like holding a child through a spinal tap&mdash;she is in awe of what her own parents faced.</p><p>She&rsquo;s seen a mother who quit her job to spend eight months in the hospital while her child was treated. And a retired military man who relocated from Pensacola to Jacksonville so his sick grandchild&rsquo;s mother could keep working; he calls it &ldquo;Just another deployment.&rdquo;</p><p>Cook favors anything that gives these families hope.</p><p>&ldquo;The kids have gone through the wringer and come out on the other side,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It means the world to families to have these advancements in research.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Unfinished business</strong></p><p>The successes are very real, but there is still much work to do, said Dr. Katzenstein. Several types of cancers, including many brain tumors and most solid tumors that have spread, continue to have dismal survival rates.</p><p>And, for those cancers that now have high survival rates, research has shifted to reducing the long-term side effects of pediatric cancer treatment. A bone marrow transplant often leads to infertility, he said. Aggressive chemotherapy treatments attack healthy tissue along with cancer cells, and may cause permanent damage.</p><p>It will be clinical trials once again that will shape progress, Dr. Katzenstein said. Only one-third of the cost of clinical trials today is financed by the government. The balance depends on philanthropy.</p><p>It&rsquo;s what keeps hope alive for so many who are fighting a disease that no child should have to face.</p><p><em>To learn more about cancer care at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/cancer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>wolfsonchildrens.com</em></a><em>.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>As they age, many people experience a loss of muscle mass, a condition called sarcopenia. This condition can lead to issues with balance, putting individuals at risk for falling, as well as a predictable downward spiral of functional strength.</p><p>Although sarcopenia is a natural part of aging, it is possible to slow its progress through regular exercise. It&rsquo;s not just about feeling healthier in general. It&rsquo;s a matter of balance and reducing your risk of a fall.</p><p>Many people aren&rsquo;t aware that, by far, falls are the leading cause of injury-related emergency department visits for older adults. Falls are the major cause of hip fractures, and responsible for more than half of fatal head injuries, according to the National Council on Aging.</p><p>September is Healthy Aging Month and a good time for seniors, particularly those over the age of 65, to take stock of their balance and mobility. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard the saying &ldquo;use it or lose it,&rdquo; when it comes to physical conditioning. The same applies to seniors who lose strength, stamina and endurance if they don&rsquo;t stay active. Bruce Cathcart, a specially trained geriatric physical therapist with the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-agewell-institute\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist AgeWell Center for Senior Health</a>, says a sedentary lifestyle causes muscles to become weak and bones to become brittle.</p><p>&ldquo;There is so much reaction time lost due to aging. The main thing to combat this is to maintain or enhance your exercise routine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And people who have slowed down a lot can actually gain a lot of functional strength back by just starting to exercise.&rdquo;</p><p>Because seniors have less muscle mass to work with, it can be harder for them to complete everyday tasks such as getting out of chairs, cars or bed, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/geriatrician/dr-raphael-balbino-md\" target=\"_blank\">Raphael Balbino, MD</a>, a family physician trained in geriatric medicine at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/agewell-center-for-senior-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist AgeWell</a>. Some seniors also take multiple medications that may cause dizziness and contribute to their risk of falling.</p><p>&ldquo;From a geriatric perspective, we try to identify if people are on more meds than they need to be, and if they are exercising regularly and paying attention to their nutrition and hydration,&rdquo; said Dr. Balbino.</p><p>Seniors who are actually at risk for a fall with injury or simply avoiding walking and moving can benefit from a comprehensive physical therapy assessment and treatment plan that can help maintain and even improve their safety.</p><p>Signs that you may benefit from this type of program:</p><ul><li>Apprehension about losing balance or falling</li><li>Sedentary lifestyle or lack of physical activity</li><li>Difficulty or slowness with walking</li><li>Difficulty getting down on or up from the floor</li><li>Complaints of fatigue, weakness or lack of energy</li></ul><p>Cathcart said chair exercises are beneficial to the heart, but do little to enhance balance. Muscle-strengthening exercises will not only prepare seniors for sudden falls, but also help prevent them.</p><p>&ldquo;Otherwise,&rdquo; said Dr. Balbino, &ldquo;they are going to lose that muscle mass and won&rsquo;t be able to recruit it when they really need it.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you are concerned about balance issues, you may benefit from an evaluation by AgeWell&rsquo;s InBalance program. A geriatric physical therapist uses a variety of assessments to measure and treat balance issues in patients 65 and above, and to establish a baseline to develop a customized conditioning schedule. The program is for individuals covered by Medicare but a physician&rsquo;s order is required to participate. Call 904.202.4243 to schedule an appointment.</em></p>",

If ovarian cancer is found at stage 1 or 2, it&rsquo;s very likely to be curable. But only 20 percent of cases are like this. Doctors usually discover early-stage ovarian cancer by stumbling upon it. For example, a CT scan is taken after a car accident and shows a mass on the ovary. It&rsquo;s a lucky catch.</p><p>More often, ovarian cancer is diagnosed at stage 3 or 4. With treatment, the disease typically goes into complete remission. But it also typically returns.</p><p>&ldquo;Once it recurs, it starts to outsmart our treatments,&rdquo; Dr. Whitworth said. &ldquo;And every successive treatment becomes less and less successful.&rdquo;</p><p>Unlike other reproductive system cancers, researchers have not found an effective way to screen for ovarian cancer. In a small percentage of cases, a gene mutation called BRCA is present.

He capped his career as a conductor on &ldquo;through&rdquo; or non-stop freight trains.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I can almost see the switching yard from here,&rdquo; said Starling as he gazed out a window on the fourth floor of the Heart Hospital at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>, where he recently underwent a new minimally invasive heart procedure.</p><p>&ldquo;I worked in the yard for 25 years breaking up trains into different classifications. It was a lot of walking. When a doctor told me to get off my knees, I rode through freights from Savannah to Jacksonville. That was before they started phasing out the caboose.&rdquo;</p><p>Starling retired from the railroad in 2001. He traveled the country in a motorhome after that, once spending six months in Alaska. He stopped traveling after his wife of 34 years died in 2016. Soon afterward, Starling started feeling weak and out of breath. It got to where he couldn&rsquo;t walk his dogs or walk to the street to check his mail.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I even had trouble getting out of bed in the morning,&rdquo; said Starling, who had a pair of open-heart surgeries in 2009 to replace both his aortic and mitral valves, and was told he would never survive a third open-heart surgery. &ldquo;My cardiologist told me I might be a good candidate for another surgery where they don&rsquo;t have to cut your chest open. That got my attention right away.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>First to undergo TMVR</strong></p><p>The new procedure, known as Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement (TMVR), involves placing a new mitral valve in the heart by threading a catheter through a main vein in the leg. The third-generation device (Edwards SAPIEN 3) is commonly used to replace worn-out aortic valves, but recently was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to replace faulty mitral valves as well.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"u-size1of2 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Dr. Satpathy and her patient, Sammie Starling\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1523479263/Juice/Satpathy.jpg\"></div><p>Starling, 80, was the first patient at Baptist Jacksonville to undergo TMVR.</p><p>&ldquo;There are no incisions in the chest and no incision in the groin,&rdquo; said Starling&rsquo;s interventional cardiologist, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/interventional-cardiologist/dr-ruby-satpathy-md\">Ruby Satpathy, MD</a>, director of the Structural Heart Program at Baptist Jacksonville. &ldquo;I do what I call a &lsquo;magic stitch&rsquo; to close the vein. Mr. Starling was originally scheduled to have the procedure later in February, but we moved it up after his condition worsened. After I performed the surgery, he felt significantly better right away and went home in two days.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>New clinical trials&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Dr. Satpathy specializes in a number of minimally invasive procedures, namely MitraClip&reg; to reduce blood leakage in the mitral valve, TAVR, to replace the aortic valve, and WATCHMAN&trade; and LARIAT&reg; for patients with atrial fibrillation who are at a high risk of bleeding and stroke. Baptist is also taking part in a number of randomized control trials, both nationally and internationally, including one that combines WATCHMAN&trade; and TAVR.</p><p>&ldquo;A lot of people have aortic valve problems who can&rsquo;t take blood thinners. In this new trial called WATCH-TAVR, patients will have WATCHMAN&trade; at the same time as TAVR,&rdquo; said Dr. Satpathy, adding that Baptist was chosen to take part in the study due to its high volume of TAVR and WATCHMAN&trade; surgeries. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve personally performed about 1,000 TAVR procedures in my career, and I&rsquo;ve been doing TAVR with twilight sleep (no general anesthesia) since 2014. This allows the patient to go home within 24 or 48 hours after treatment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Before his TMVR procedure, Starling could barely walk without getting winded. Two days after the surgery, he was walking around the nursing station and up and down a flight of stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a different man now than when I walked in here,&rdquo; added Starling, who enjoys hunting and fishing in the Osceola National Forest about an hour west of his Jacksonville home. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need a license to hunt deer at my age.

Rathore, MD</a>, remembers a year when he skipped it. It was 1990. He got the flu.</p><p>&ldquo;I was very sick,&rdquo; said Dr. Rathore, co-chairman of the Baptist Health Infection Prevention and Control Committee and chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease and Immunology for <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.com\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>. &ldquo;I was knocked out for five days. And I was a young man then. It was terrible.&rdquo;</p><p>If you think of flu as just a mild illness, here&rsquo;s a bit of history: This year marks the 100th anniversary of the flu pandemic of 1918, still considered to be the deadliest disease outbreak ever. An estimated one-third of the world&rsquo;s population became infected with the virus, and the number of deaths totaled at least 50 million, three times the number of soldiers killed in World War I, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Of course, there was no flu shot then. And pandemics&mdash;which only happen when there is a new strain of virus for which people have no previous exposure&mdash;are pretty rare compared to annual flu mutations. A flu pandemic has occurred only four times in the last 100 years. But still it goes to show, the flu is no disease to trifle with.</p><p>Last winter&rsquo;s flu season was especially bad, classified as &ldquo;high severity&rdquo; by the CDC. There are two reasons why.</p><p>That season&rsquo;s main flu strain, H3N2, tends to have poorer outcomes than other types of flu, Dr. Rathore said. Also, last year&rsquo;s vaccine did not match very well the particular strain of flu that was circulating.</p><p>It&rsquo;s too soon to predict the severity of this year&rsquo;s flu season.</p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t really know that until the flu starts circulating,&rdquo; Dr. Rathore said.</p><p>That&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll know the strain of the predominant influenza virus that is circulating and also, whether it matches the vaccine.</p><p>Here are three reasons you&rsquo;ll want to get vaccinated early:</p><p>While a case of the flu is most often mild, sometimes it&rsquo;s not. A bad case can lead to hospitalization and even death from complications. &nbsp;</p><p>Everyone is susceptible to flu. Those most at risk are children, the elderly and people with underlying conditions, such as HIV, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung disease and sickle cell disease. Even so, healthy adults can get sick, too.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re in good health and think you&rsquo;ll only get a mild case at worst, you can still pass the flu on to people near you who are more susceptible, like children, the elderly and people with underlying conditions.</p><p>The CDC recommends flu shots for everyone 6 months of age and older.</p><p>It may seem confusing that pharmacies advertise flu shots in the summer. Peak flu season actually runs from October through March.</p><p>Offering shots earlier lets people get vaccinated ahead of the main season. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the blood. The updated flu vaccine always becomes available in August.</p><p>&ldquo;We hope that by sometime in October, most people will already be immunized against influenza,&rdquo; Dr. Rathore said.</p><p>And if you don&rsquo;t get around to it by October, doing so later in the season is still beneficial.</p><p><br></p><p><em>To get your flu shot, make an appointment with a&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care/locations\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Primary Care&nbsp;</em><em>physician</em></a><em>&nbsp;or visit any Walgreens pharmacies.</em></p><p><br></p>",

Most women improve during the second trimester, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/obstetrician-and-gynecologist/dr-jason-van-bennekom-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jason VanBennekom, MD</a>, with North Florida OB/GYN and chairman of the OB/GYN Department at Baptist Medical Center South.</p><p>&ldquo;It helps to know it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s going to be happening all nine months,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>To ease the misery until then, doctors advise dietary changes and natural remedies first, then prescription medications if symptoms persist.</p><p>Here are the top tips we heard from OB/GYNs:</p><p><strong>1. Change your diet.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Eat very frequently and eat small meals. You should snack throughout the day to make sure you have something in your stomach, but you should also avoid being overly full. If you are sick in the morning, keep some crackers or nuts by the bed, so you can eat something before you get up.&rdquo;</p><p>-<em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/obstetrician-and-gynecologist/dr-blake-butterworth-md\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Blake Butterworth, MD</em></a><em>, an obstetrician and gynecologist with North Florida OB/GYN who delivers at Baptist Medical Center South</em></p><p>&ldquo;Your diet will often be carbohydrate-heavy in early pregnancy because carbs tend to settle morning sickness a lot better than other food groups. Mix protein with the carbs so your blood sugar stays steady. You might worry about weight gain and not having a balanced diet, but in the first trimester, we&rsquo;re just trying to get you through your day.&rdquo;</p><p>- <em>Dr. Walsh</em></p><p>&ldquo;Avoid spicy, fatty or processed foods. Bland foods are usually tolerated better, and women should get plenty of fluids. Food aversions are very real. Avoid foods that make you nauseous. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t even need to eat it to know&mdash;just the thought of eating X is enough to make you feel sick.&rdquo;</p><p>- <em>Dr. VanBennekom</em></p><p><strong>2. Try natural and over-the-counter remedies.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Ginger can sometimes settle your stomach. There have actually been studies that have shown it has a real benefit. Try any ginger-containing food, like ginger ales that contain real ginger or any kind of ginger tea.&rdquo;</p><p>- <em>Dr. Butterworth</em></p><p>&ldquo;Some women get relief using massage, acupuncture or acupressure. Sometimes women will use Sea-Bands&reg;, which put a little pressure on the wrists. There are women who are helped by essential oils, like peppermint and lemon. Or you could drink tea with peppermint, lemon or chamomile. Even something as simple as using a hand soap scented with lemon can help.&rdquo;</p><p>- <em>Dr. VanBennekom</em></p><p>&ldquo;Diclegis is a prescription drug that helps a lot of women, but it&rsquo;s basically just Unisom&reg; and B6. So if your insurance won&rsquo;t cover it, talk to your doctor about taking over-the-counter Unisom&reg; with vitamin B6 or vitamin B complex. Medicines like Zantac&reg; may also ease the nausea that comes with acid reflux.&rdquo;</p><p>- <em>Dr. Walsh</em></p><p><strong>3. You may need to move to prescription medications for severe symptoms.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Diclegis would be the first thing we would try. After that, you might use Phenergan&trade; or Reglan&reg;. We see Zofran&reg; used quite a bit and it works in cases of really severe nausea. There&rsquo;re a couple studies that show an increased risk of cardiac abnormalities, though. So it&rsquo;s not really a first-line medication anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>- <em>Dr. VanBennekom</em></p><p><strong>4. Know the warning signs of something serious.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very common for women to have nausea and vomiting. But if you&rsquo;re losing a lot of weight and you can&rsquo;t keep fluids down, we don&rsquo;t want you to just sit at home thinking that&rsquo;s normal. You probably need to call your OB/GYN or just come to the hospital.&rdquo;</p><p>- <em>Dr. Butterworth</em></p><p><em>For help relieving morning sickness and other pregnancy-related concerns, please consult your OB/GYN.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Tallahassee newborn with rare congenital condition will need &lsquo;lifetime surveillance&rsquo; after complex surgery to repair his tiny heart.</p><p>Ashlee Hobbs has delivered four babies in the past 12 years, but her most recent bundle of joy, Lynn Williams, Jr., weighed in at a bell-ringing 8 pounds, 6 ounces on Feb. 2, 2017.</p><p>&ldquo;My other boys were all in the 6-pound range, so he was my biggest,&rdquo; said the 27-year-old, stay-at-home mom who delivered all four of her boys at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare (TMH).</p><p>But something about her latest pregnancy didn&rsquo;t seem quite right.</p><p>Around the eighth month, Hobbs developed preeclampsia, a condition marked by high blood pressure and swelling in the feet, legs and hands. She eventually underwent an emergency C-section, but a day after birth, Lynn Jr.&rsquo;s pediatrician picked up a murmur in her newborn child&rsquo;s heart. <a href=\"https://www.tmh.org/physician-directory/v/vining-justin-m\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Vining, MD</a>, a pediatric cardiologist with <a href=\"https://www.tmh.org/services/children/wolfson-childrens-specialty-center-at-tallahassee-memorial-healthcare?utm_source=www.tmh.org/wolfson\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Specialty Center at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare</a>, was alerted to the finding and immediately ordered a sonogram of the baby&rsquo;s heart, which revealed a rare heart condition known as Tetralogy of Fallot. This congenital heart defect occurs in about one in 2,500 births and requires open-heart surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;Right then, I began a lifelong relationship with this baby,&rdquo; said Dr. Vining, who is in practice at the Wolfson Children&#39;s at TMH with Louis St. Petery, MD, Tallahassee Primary Care Associates.</p><p>Dr. Vining added that one of the components of Tetralogy of Fallot is a ventricular septal defect, or a hole in the septum between the two lower pumping chambers of his heart. &ldquo;Fortunately for Lynn, it was a small one, but his heart condition will need lifetime surveillance.&rdquo;</p><p>A day after he was born, Lynn Jr. was admitted to Tallahassee Memorial&rsquo;s Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). &ldquo;I had never been in an ICU for babies before. It was all very overwhelming,&rdquo; said Hobbs. &ldquo;But Dr. Vining let us know everything that was going on. He even drew pictures of our son&rsquo;s heart to show us what was happening.&rdquo;</p><p>Two days after his birth, Lynn Jr. was transferred from TMH to the Level III NICU at <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a> to further receive specialized heart care. This transfer utilized a specially designed ambulance known as the Kids Kare Mobile ICU, which is equipped to ensure Lynn Jr&rsquo;s safe arrival to Jacksonville. After additional tests were performed on his heart in Jacksonville, Lynn Jr. met his brothers, Jaidyn, 12, DeMaris, 9, and DeAwndrai, 5, for the first time.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Vining said that as long as he wasn&rsquo;t turning blue, he would be fine,&rdquo; added Hobbs, who returned to Jacksonville in mid-April for Lynn&rsquo;s diagnostic cardiac catheterization, a minimally invasive procedure that lets the physician look inside the heart. Performed by pediatric cardiologist <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatric-cardiologist/dr-robert-english-md\" target=\"_blank\">Robert English, MD</a>, of UF Health Pediatric Cardiovascular Center, the procedure was followed by open-heart surgery in the cardiovascular OR at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, performed by pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatric-cardiothoracic-surgeon/dr-michael-shillingford-md\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Shillingford, MD</a>, and his team.</p><p>Tetralogy of Fallot is one of the more common heart conditions cardiologists manage at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, according to Dr. English. &ldquo;We see it pretty often. My job is to give the surgeon a good road map to follow when he goes in to fix the defect. The surgery typically takes one or two hours in the morning and the patient is off the bypass machine by noon,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>In non-emergency situations, Jacksonville-area patients with a similar diagnosis may have surgery a week after their heart catheterization procedure, while out-of-town patients like Lynn Jr. usually have their surgery much sooner. &ldquo;We try to minimize their road time,&rdquo; added Dr. English. &ldquo;We have five Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Specialty Centers where we provide outpatient pediatric cardiology services, including at the one in Tallahassee, but that&rsquo;s still a long way for some of these families.&rdquo;</p><p>Hobbs and her husband, Lynn Williams Sr., said they received updates from the surgical and Cardiovascular ICU teams at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s during their son&rsquo;s complex heart surgery, which included &ldquo;a moderate amount&rdquo; of stitching to close the hole in his heart, according to Dr. Shillingford. &ldquo;It seemed like forever when he was on the ventilator,&rdquo; said Hobbs, &ldquo;but when Dr. Shillingford told me that he came out of it OK, I cried tears of joy.&rdquo; Lynn Sr. was so pleased with the outcome that he wrote Dr. Shillingford a personal note, thanking him for being &ldquo;a man of his word.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Added Dr. Shillingford: &ldquo;I was very pleased with the result and for the opportunity to positively impact the life of Lynn and his family.&rdquo;</p><p>Before the surgery, Hobbs said her youngest son used to wake up every morning with a frown on his face. &ldquo;Now, he wakes up a happy baby,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was all worth it just to see that smile. I give all his doctors my praises. They worked wonders with my son. They sure did.&rdquo;</p><p>To learn more about congenital heart disease, visit <a href=\"https://www.tmh.org/services/children/wolfson-childrens-specialty-center-at-tallahassee-memorial-healthcare\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&#39;s Specialty Center at Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>When preparing for a baby, new parents invest time and money into babyproofing their home so their little one is safe as they learn and grow in their new environment. They install covers for electrical outlets and locks for cabinets, cover sharp furniture edges and block off stairways.</p><p>What they don&rsquo;t know is that some of the most popular baby products can be just as unsafe for infants &mdash; even fatal &mdash; if used improperly or without close supervision.</p><p>&ldquo;Most of these products are helpful to parents, but none should be used without reading and following the owner&rsquo;s manual. It&rsquo;s important that babies are never left unattended with any of these products,&rdquo; said Cynthia Dennis, RN, coordinator of <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/safe-kids-northeast-florida\" target=\"_blank\">Safe Kids Northeast Florida</a>, led by THE PLAYERS Center for Child Health at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>Dennis also recommends checking the packaging of every product to make sure it is recommended for the age of the child, and says to register any products that come with manufacturer registration cards.</p><p>&ldquo;This information is never used for marketing or junk mail,&rdquo; Dennis said. &ldquo;It gives the company a way to contact you should the product you purchased have a recall issued, which could affect your child&rsquo;s safety.&rdquo;</p><p>Here are some of the top products that can increase the risk of sleep-related deaths, including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and how to prevent things from going wrong once parents bring baby home to their new pillows, seats and swings.</p><p><strong>Babocush, Dock-A-Tot&trade; and Boppy&reg; pillows</strong></p><p>These products are all different types of baby body cushions &mdash; padded, portable and soft. They&rsquo;re safe for supervised play time and bonding with parents while awake, but baby cushions become unsafe when used for sleep.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) warns against letting babies sleep on soft surfaces because they can roll over and block their own airways, causing suffocation. Leaving babies unattended in baby cushions &mdash; like while sleeping, using them as padding in a play pen or as a co-sleeping tool &mdash; significantly increases the risk of suffocation.</p><p>Also, always place baby body pillows on hard surfaces rather than couches or mattresses, and never in an enclosed space. When placed on soft surfaces, suffocation risk increases. When used in an enclosed space, the baby can become trapped between the cushion and the enclosure if they roll too far.</p><p><strong>Bumpers</strong></p><p>On a stroll through any baby store, parents will see cribs made up with adorable bedding sets, which almost always come with matching cloth bumpers. However, the AAP recommends leaving bumpers out of cribs because they have been proven to increase the risk of suffocation, strangulation and entrapment. Pediatricians do not recommend any type of bumpers, even those made of mesh.</p><p>&ldquo;Infants lack the motor skills and strength to turn their heads should they roll into or under a bumper, which can block their breathing,&rdquo; Dennis said.</p><p><strong>Crib hammocks</strong></p><p>Crib hammocks are also a hazard to safe sleep. Companies claim their hammocks can reduce the risk of SIDS because the hammock&rsquo;s mesh material allows airflow even if the baby rolls over. The baby&rsquo;s body weight also causes the hammock to pull the fabric in around his body, preventing him from rolling over as easily in his sleep. However, these products often position the newborn&rsquo;s neck in such a way that the airway may be blocked, causing suffocation despite those other claims of reducing risk.</p><p><strong>Wearable baby monitors</strong></p><p>Many wearable monitors are marketed as products that will give parents peace of mind by allowing them to monitor their baby&rsquo;s vitals while they sleep. Some say they will detect when the baby rolls onto his or her stomach or stops breathing.</p><p>However, studies show these monitors do not reduce the risk of SIDS because they present new problems. Monitors can experience connectivity issues or set off false alarms, causing stress for parents or even unnecessary ER visits to reassure parents their little one is OK.</p><p>In addition, for some parents, wearable monitors can create a false sense of security and make them less likely to check on their baby. Only medical-grade devices should be trusted to accurately read and deliver information about vital signs and breathing.</p><p><strong>Rock &lsquo;n Play&trade;</strong></p><p>The Rock &lsquo;n Play&trade; is another product that is not recommended for unobserved sleep because it does not meet the AAP requirement for babies to sleep on their backs on a firm, flat surface.</p><p>&ldquo;The Rock n&rsquo; Play&trade; puts the baby in a semi-reclined position and increases the risk of blocking the airway, leading to restricted breathing,&rdquo; explained Dennis.</p><p><strong>Car seats</strong></p><p>Car seats aren&rsquo;t just a popular product &mdash; they&rsquo;re a necessity. But AAP guidelines clearly state that sitting devices, such as car seats, strollers, swings, infant carriers and infant slings, are not recommended for routine sleep in the hospital or at home, particularly for young infants.</p><p>&ldquo;If a car seat is properly installed according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s directions and the baby is correctly buckled in, sleeping in the car for short rides is fine,&rdquo; said Dennis. &ldquo;For an extended car trip, the AAP recommends getting the baby out of the seat periodically for a break. However, when the car seat carrier is taken out of the car, due to the change in the angle of the seat and its instability, it is recommended that you take the little one out of the seat and put him into his normal sleeping place as soon as possible, where he can sleep lying on his back.&rdquo;</p><p>While the baby product market features a variety of &ldquo;must-have&rdquo; inventions for making life as new parents easier, buyers and users must be aware of their baby&rsquo;s unique safety needs. Following the correct use and warnings found in products&rsquo; owner&rsquo;s manuals and the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics for safe sleep is the best way to ensure babies are sleeping safely.</p><p><br></p><p><em>For more information about safe sleep for infants, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/infant-safety\" target=\"_blank\"><em>wolfsonchildrens.com/safesleep</em></a><em>.

About 14 million people, including teens, become newly infected with HPV each year.</p><p>Most people with HPV never develop symptoms or health problems, and most HPV infections (nine out of 10) go away by themselves within two years.

Recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved the age expansion for the HPV vaccine to be used in men and women between the ages 27 to 45.</p><p>The CDC recommends that children ages 11 to 12 be vaccinated for HPV cancers at the same time they receive shots for meningitis and whooping cough. Dr. Smith agrees with the CDC that getting your child the HPV vaccine early is much better than being treated for an HPV-related cancer later in life.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it should be part of the standard childhood shot regime, but unfortunately the vaccination rate is barely above 50 percent right now,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It has a different connotation than, say, getting a shot for tetanus or polio Some parents may be resistant to having their children get the HPV vaccine because of concerns regarding their future sexual behavior.&rdquo;</p><p>With more than 100 million total doses administered in the United States, the HPV vaccine has a reassuring safety record that&rsquo;s backed by 10 years of monitoring and research, says the CDC. But like any vaccine or medicine, the HPV vaccine can cause side effects, the most common being pain, redness or swelling in the arm where the shot was given; dizziness, fainting, nausea and headache. Fainting after any vaccine, including HPV vaccine, is more common among adolescents.</p><p>But preventing cancer is always better than treating it.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really the key,&rdquo; added Dr. Smith. &ldquo;Why are we vaccinating people so young? Because we want the vaccination to be completed and in place so that people are developing immunity well before they have a risk of having sexual exposure to this cancer-causing virus.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Talk to your&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\"><em>primary care provider</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em><em>about whether you or your child should get the HPV vaccine or any other vaccinations that can protect you from devastating diseases.</em></p>",

She was also affected by hydrocephalus, which resulted in needing a shunt as a baby.&rdquo;</p><p>Today Chloe is 14 years old, a rising eighth grader who loves reading, singer Ed Sheeran and going to equine therapy. She has cerebral palsy &mdash; a disorder affecting movement or muscle tone caused by damage to the developing brain &mdash; as a result of her stroke before birth. Like many children with cerebral palsy Chloe has experienced muscle spasticity, meaning some of her muscles are constantly tightened and restrict her movement. Chloe&rsquo;s right arm was weak and her right leg&rsquo;s muscles were so taut she couldn&rsquo;t straighten her knee, making it difficult to walk.</p><p>&ldquo;It was like she was a statue,&rdquo; Provenza said. &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t able to sit cross-legged. She couldn&rsquo;t participate in activities with climbing or that required her to maneuver herself around. It was hard just playing games and keeping up with other kids.&rdquo;</p><p>For most of her life, Chloe has been a patient of <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-orthopedic-surgeon/dr-eric-loveless-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Loveless, MD,</a> pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s and Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care. He has performed numerous surgeries to repair damage to Chloe&rsquo;s joints caused by her spasticity. Also managing her spasticity was <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-physiatrist/dr-louise-spierre-md\" target=\"_blank\">Louise Spierre, MD,</a> pediatric physiatrist with the UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville.</p><p>&ldquo;Our goal is to get patients to their highest possible functional level and improve their comfort,&rdquo; said Dr. Spierre. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been involved in Chloe&rsquo;s care for years. We provided nonsurgical management of her spasticity and we closely monitored her progress with interventions. If a patient isn&rsquo;t progressing, we meet as a team and discuss further interventions. This team-based approach is what really differentiates our spasticity care program.&rdquo;</p><p>Physical medicine and rehabilitation, orthopedic and neurosurgical specialists all met to discuss Chloe&rsquo;s case. After the team discussion and speaking with Chloe about her goals, her doctors referred her to Dr. Ranalli for a specialized procedure they felt would finally improve her spasticity &mdash; selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR).</p><p>During SDR, surgeons make a small incision in the back, and remove a small amount of bone from the base of the spine to expose the point where all of the nerves are bundled within the spinal column. Then, each sensory nerve between vertebra L1 and S1 is stimulated with a small electrical signal to determine which ones serve which muscle groups, and about 50 percent of the ones connected to spastic muscle groups are snipped.</p><p>&ldquo;In kids with spasticity, the body&rsquo;s ability to regulate how the muscles contract has been altered,&rdquo; said Dr. Ranalli. &ldquo;Our goal is to interrupt that abnormal sensory input. We carefully select and cut 50 to 60 percent of the sensory roots causing the most spasticity. This is the magic number to give more control without numbness.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Learning more about spasticity</strong></p><p>Melanie and Chloe started doing their research. Spasticity affects many children with cerebral palsy, and within that community, one doctor&rsquo;s name kept coming up: Dr. T.S. Park. Dr. Park pioneered a minimally invasive version of SDR that very few neurosurgeons in the country can perform. Dr. Ranalli trained under Dr. Park in St. Louis and offers the same procedure here in Jacksonville. <a href=\"https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings\" target=\"_blank\"><em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em></a> also ranks Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital among the top 50 hospitals in the nation pediatric neurology and neurosurgery, making it an ideal place for Chloe to undergo an otherwise intimidating surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;This was her 12th surgery,&rdquo; said Provenza. &ldquo;All of them were related to her spasticity. I was scared to death because this time it involved her spine, but I trusted Dr. Ranalli. I researched a lot through speaking with Dr. Park and his team, who specialize in this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was able to adopt the evidence-based techniques and processes from that training, including a smaller incision, less bone removed and intense physical therapy that goes on for about a year after the surgery,&rdquo; said Dr. Ranalli.</p><p>After some deliberation, Chloe and her parents decided SDR was right for her. She recovered in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Wolfson and began physical therapy with <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/rehabilitation\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&#39;s Rehabilitation</a> three days after her surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;Following SDR we see a pretty quick reduction in spasticity,&rdquo; said Dr. Ranalli. &ldquo;Patients like Chloe have muscles that were once very tight and spastic, but have become kind of floppy and look weak. Then comes physical therapy to get stronger and help their bodies learn to use those limbs again.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>An amazing recovery</strong></p><p>After just three weeks, Chloe and her mom could already see a difference.</p><p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t straighten her knee before, but now she&rsquo;s just shy of it being able to hold it perfectly straight,&rdquo; said Provenza. &ldquo;She can actually bend her leg at the knee and sit crisscross. Walking will get a lot easier as she continues to strengthen her leg and is able to lift her foot up when she&rsquo;s walking. Hopefully this will take away the discomfort of being so tight all the time.&rdquo;</p><p>Chloe will undergo extensive therapy physical therapy four days a week for at least six months, and may continue for a year or longer depending on her needs.</p><p>&ldquo;In many cases, the full benefits aren&rsquo;t realized for six months to a year after the procedure,&rdquo; explained Dr. Ranalli. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re always happy when kids seem to do well within a few weeks, but more change is expected the further out you get. When we sign patients up for surgery, we&rsquo;re asking families to sign up for an extended physical therapy regimen too, otherwise their child is not going to benefit.&rdquo;</p><p>Chloe and her mom are glad to have had access to minimally invasive SDR in their hometown of Jacksonville, and are happy it was available where she was already comfortable at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital has been incredible,&rdquo; said Provenza. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to me that she has these great relationships with her doctors and they treat her like one of their kids. They all love her and treat her very kindly. She had never met Dr. Ranalli before this, but she took to him very quickly. And the nurses are just wonderful. When we were moved to the 5th floor, her nurses from the PICU came up to visit her. They would sit with her, talk with her and hug her. One of the employees from the lunchroom even brought her cake for her birthday.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Ranalli added, &ldquo;The potential for Chloe is great because she&rsquo;s very intelligent and very hardworking. You need to be able to engage in pretty intense physical therapy after surgery, so those qualities made her a great candidate for the surgery.&rdquo;</p><p><br></p><p><em>Visit <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/brain/cerebral-palsy-and-spasticity\" target=\"_blank\">wolfsonchildrens.com/spasticity</a> for more information about the management of cerebral palsy and spasticity.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Can you feel happier just by eating a bag of kale chips? How about some probiotic yogurt? We&rsquo;d love for it to be that simple.</p><p>A team of psychiatric researchers has asked scientists and clinicians who study and treat depression to start paying attention to a list they have compiled of &ldquo;Antidepressant Foods.&rdquo;</p><p>Oysters, mussels, organ meats, leafy greens, lettuces and peppers ranked high. That&rsquo;s because they are dense in nutrients widely reported to support emotional well-being.</p><p>The rankings are meant to aid other medical professionals, because &ldquo;No current food rating scale focuses on nutrients required for mental health,&rdquo; the report said.</p><p>The study by Drew Ramsey, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, and Laura LaChance with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto was released in June in the World Journal of Psychiatry.</p><p><strong>So, can you eat your way to happiness?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Medical experts cautiously support the idea. But, they say not to get too carried away. Food is just one variable in a very long equation that adds up to mental well being.</p><p>&ldquo;The body-brain connection is real, your body is connected to your brain and your brain is connected to your body. They&rsquo;re all one thing,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-karla-repper-phd\" target=\"_blank\">Karla Repper, PhD</a>, &nbsp;a clinical psychologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>. &ldquo;But, it&rsquo;s hard to say whether certain foods can improve our mood because there are so many different things that affect how we feel.&rdquo;</p><p>Exercise, constructive behavior and mindfulness all contribute to happiness as well.</p><p>Perhaps easier to correlate is that the wrong foods can make people feel terrible.</p><p>Gluten can make people with celiac disease feel sluggish. Sugar can make people with diabetes feel restless. When kids demonstrate ADHD behavior, foods with red dye are a possible culprit. In people who don&rsquo;t have underlying conditions, skipping breakfast can make them feel exhausted, and soda delivers an energy spike and then, a crash.</p><p>Even the relationship between bad foods and moods can get complicated.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost like a double-edged sword,&rdquo; said Katherine Margaritis, a registered clinical dietitian with Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville. &ldquo;The way we feel impacts the foods we want. But also, the foods we want can impact and worsen the way we feel.&rdquo;</p><p>For example, someone who&rsquo;s in a bad mood and goes out and eats a pint of ice cream could spiral into an even deeper depression.</p><p>On the upside, healthy foods do seem to support better moods. But we normally just think of it as &ldquo;feeling healthy,&rdquo; Margaritis said.</p><p>&ldquo;The best strategy is to go for balance. All the food groups offer different nutrients and different benefits to your body.&rdquo;</p><p>Carbohydrates provide glucose for energy. Protein delivers glucose control. Unsaturated fats surround and protect nerves that carry messages from the brain. Water distributes the vitamins that are needed everywhere.</p><p>Be careful about singling out a single food as a cure-all, both health professionals said. That often leads to fad diets or other misguided choices.</p><p>&ldquo;There have been so many claims about diet that haven&rsquo;t worked out in science,&rdquo; Dr. Repper said. &ldquo;Like a gluten-free diet among healthy people. All of a sudden, there are all these people who aren&rsquo;t eating gluten. It can be a distraction from what people really need to do.&rdquo;</p><p>Margaritis had an uncle with diabetes who showed her a handout from the doctor&rsquo;s office on what foods to eat. Cherries were on his list.</p><p>&ldquo;So he got cherries,&rdquo; Margaritis said. &ldquo;He had a whole shelf of maraschino cherries.&rdquo;</p><p>Not even close to an antidote.</p>",

Every year, an estimated 40,000 people in the U.S. experience a ruptured aneurysm, which can cause a stroke. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Just like a heart attack, there is usually no warning that a brain aneurysm might rupture. So how can you lower your chances of having an aneurysm?&nbsp;</p><p>First, identify your risks and control what you can. Many risk factors can be eliminated simply through a healthier lifestyle. Smoking, alcohol or drug abuse, high blood pressure or uncontrolled diabetes can make you more susceptible.&nbsp;</p><p>Other factors are not in your control, like having a family history of aneurysms. In fact, if you have a family member with a brain aneurysm, your risk of having one increases from 4 percent to 6 percent. That risk doubles to 8 percent if you have two family members with an aneurysm.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Early detection can save your life,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-ricardo-hanel-md\">Ricardo A. Hanel, MD, PhD,</a> director of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/lyerly-neurosurgery\">Baptist Neurological Institute</a> in Jacksonville.&nbsp;</p><p>A simple, noninvasive imaging test, called an MRA can detect if an aneurysm is present. Your primary care doctor can order the test or refer you to a neurologist if needed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Family history is the highest predictor of developing an aneurysm,&rdquo; Dr. Hanel said. &ldquo;If you have a strong history of brain aneurysms in your family, you should get screened right away. Anyone who has two or more relatives with an aneurysm should be checked every five to 10 years starting at age 20.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Hanel also noted that women are more likely to have an aneurysm, as are those who&rsquo;ve had one in the past. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Having had an aneurysm means there is a 15 to 20 percent chance you will develop another. If you are at risk, you need to be closely monitored by a skilled endovascular neurosurgeon to prevent another occurrence,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is that most aneurysms are treatable. Dr. Hanel, along with his colleagues <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-eric-sauvageau-md\">neurologist Eric Sauvageau, MD,&nbsp;</a>and <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/interventional-neurologist/dr-amin-aghaebrahim-md\">Nima Amin Aghaebrahim,&nbsp;</a>MD, interventional neurologist, have removed many types of aneurysms without more complex open-brain surgery, which had long been the norm.</p><p>&ldquo;Depending on the size and location, we can treat many aneurysms by going through a blood vessel in the leg and navigating up to the brain,&rdquo; Dr. Hanel said.&nbsp;</p><p>Drs. Hanel, Sauvageau and Aghaebrahim employ advanced noninvasive treatments, such as flow diverter technology, in which a braided cylindrical mesh is inserted into the aneurysm to slow the flow of blood and allow the diseased vessel to heal. The doctors can also fill the aneurysm with coils, which causes it to dry up over time.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If they can get the right treatment in time, people don&rsquo;t have to die of brain aneurysms,&rdquo; said Dr. Hanel.</p><p><strong>Aneurysm risk factors include:</strong></p><ul><li>Smoking</li><li>Older age (especially older than 50)</li><li>Family history of brain aneurysms</li><li>Gender.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among men and women, and smoking is the leading cause. However, only 5.9 percent of smokers and former smokers get lung cancer screenings, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology.</p><p>&ldquo;Early detection is critical when it comes to lung cancer,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/medical-oncologist/dr-john-vu-md\">John Vu, MD,</a> a medical oncologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center.&nbsp;</a>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s caught at stage 1, the survival rate is about 70 percent.&rdquo; Cure rates decrease to 40 to 50 percent if detected in stage 2 and go down to 25 percent at stage 3. Lung cancers detected in stage 4 have a survival rate of 5 percent.</p><p>&ldquo;Many smokers may not be aware that there is a lung cancer screening test,&rdquo; Dr. Vu said. &ldquo;And some smokers don&rsquo;t want to be tested because it would mean giving up tobacco.&rdquo;</p><p>Perhaps even more significant is the stigma between smoking and lung cancer. &ldquo;Some smokers are ashamed and embarrassed and don&rsquo;t want to learn that their bad habit may have caused them to have cancer. They feel that society views them as being responsible for their condition,&rdquo; said Dr. Vu.</p><p>The same stigma exists for people with lung cancer who never smoked. &ldquo;Although smoking is the leading cause, about 10 to 20 percent of lung cancers occur in non-smokers,&rdquo; Dr. Vu said.</p><p>The second-leading cause is exposure to radon, a colorless, odorless gas that comes from uranium found in the soil. The EPA sells radon testing kits to determine if your home has dangerous radon levels.</p><p>The third-leading cause is second-hand smoke. About 7,000 people a year die from living or working with someone who smokes. Another cause is exposure to carcinogens in asbestos, diesel exhaust and air pollution.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>On August 26, two prominent gamers were killed and 11 more were injured when a fellow competitor opened fire during a Madden 19 tournament at The Jacksonville Landing. As families, friends and the gaming community mourn, concerns are being raised once more about the relationship between violence and video games.</p><p>&quot;Violent video games have not been found to correlate with violent behavior or criminal behavior,&quot; said <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/psychiatrist/dr-raj-loungani-md\" target=\"_blank\">Raj Loungani, MD, MPH,</a> child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist with the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&#39;s Center for Behavioral Health</a>, a division of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>. &quot;In fact, some studies have shown that in the months after popular violent video games are released aggravated assault and homicide rates tend to drop, perhaps due to some aggression-reducing catharsis from playing games instead of engaging in criminal activity. For most people, gaming is a harmless hobby that is healthy and relaxing. It&#39;s only cause for concern if it leads to neglecting other activities or your responsibilities. That&#39;s why the gaming disorder diagnosis has the criteria it does.&quot;</p><p>In June, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared gaming disorder a mental health condition in its latest edition of the <em>International Classification of Diseases</em>. In order for someone to be considered addicted to video games, they have to meet a few criteria:</p><ul><li>Gaming takes precedence over other activities, such as homework, exercise or sleep.</li><li>Gaming persists even when negative consequences occur, such as a drop in grades.</li><li>Gaming impairs functioning and disrupts daily life, like a reduction in sleep or physical activity.</li><li>These criteria must be met for at least 12 months.</li></ul><p>Dr. Loungani says many parents worry their son or daughter could be addicted to gaming. Here, he answers some of the burning questions parents have about violent games, their child&rsquo;s gaming habits and the most popular game of today: <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p><strong>How long should a child or teenager play video games each day?</strong></p><p>I recommend a limit of one hour per day of video games for school-aged children and no more than two hours per day for teenagers. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting total screen time &mdash; including gaming, TV, computers and other electronic devices &mdash; to one to two hours per day. That is much less than the 6.5 hours per day actually spent by the average kid in America!</p><p>Gaming is not only here to stay, it is rapidly growing in popularity with eSports growing by 40 percent over the past year to $700 million in revenue, and to a projected $1.5 billion dollar industry by 2020. With this steep rise in popularity and accessibility to video games, further research is certainly required to investigate the links between gaming, mental health, and outcome measures &ndash; both positive and negative.</p><p><strong>Does gaming addiction affect the brain the same way as a drug or alcohol addiction?</strong></p><p>Gaming addiction is like addiction to substances like drugs or alcohol, or other addictions like gambling, in that video games directly activate the brain&#39;s reward system by increasing levels of dopamine. They potentially flood a gamer&#39;s brain with up to 10 times the normal level of dopamine.</p><p>With dopamine levels so elevated, over time more and more video gaming is needed to feel the same pleasurable effect. Repetitive gaming, like drug or alcohol use, may produce such an intense activation of the brain&#39;s reward pathway that gamers begin to neglect normal activities, like sleeping, eating, or physical activity in favor of playing, leading to significantly reduced level of functioning. That&#39;s why some call games like Fortnite &lsquo;digital heroin!&rsquo;</p><p>As with substance use and gambling disorders, in gaming disorder there is a preoccupation or obsession, as well as physical and psychological dependence. There may be cravings and withdrawal symptoms like impaired mood, sleep, motivation, or even physical symptoms like carpal tunnel syndrome, dry eyes, migraines, backaches, nausea or constipation when not playing. The gamer may use video games to relieve anxiety or guilt as a way to escape. When these symptoms are present for gamers, playing video games is no longer a harmless hobby. It can result in clinically significant impairment or distress that must be treated for the gamer&#39;s well-being.</p><p><strong>What behaviors should cause concern for parents?</strong></p><p>There is no set number of hours per day or week of gaming that signifies that a child or adolescent is addicted to video games. That said, most parents start to worry when their child&#39;s gaming creeps into 15 to 30 hours per week. As with all disorders, the extent of a problem depends on how gaming is affecting other areas of the young person&#39;s life.</p><p>Is playing video games taking precedence over basic activities of daily living like sleeping, eating, and hygiene? Is it replacing in-person socializing with family and friends with primarily interfacing with others online? Is the child or teen neglecting to attend to responsibilities like schoolwork and household chores? Is the young person gaming more often over time and procrastinating by using video games? When not playing, is he obsessing about video games and displaying changes in mood, sleep, motivation, or experiencing physical overuse or withdrawal symptoms? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, there is good reason to be concerned and seek help.</p><p><strong>What should parents do if they feel their child might be addicted to video games?</strong></p><p>There is growing evidence that children and teens addicted to video games &mdash; anywhere from 2 to 12 percent overall &mdash; may experience a host of social, emotional, and behavioral problems. If you notice the symptoms I&#39;ve described, please seek an evaluation by your primary care doctor or a behavioral health specialist. There are various evidence-based treatment modalities available for gaming addiction, as well as for any related conditions like depression, anxiety, ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders. We want to support parents and caregivers to maximize their child&#39;s or teen&#39;s level of functioning as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Why do you think <em>Fortnite</em> is becoming such a sensation among kids but such a problem for parents?</strong></p><p><em>Fortnite</em> plays to the brain&rsquo;s vulnerabilities. It rewards you based on a variable-ratio schedule, which is the most effective reinforcement strategy. It&rsquo;s why gambling and lottery games are so addictive. I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;m going to pull that slot machine lever and win big, and since I am winning here and there, I want to keep playing to get the rush of the next win. <em>Fortnite</em> plays to that same rush of not knowing when you&rsquo;ll earn a reward or win a round, tantalizing you to keep playing. Add to that the beautiful graphics and shared experience by players interacting in a common quest and livestreams on YouTube, ever-evolving pop references like game characters performing iconic dances from &quot;dabbing&quot; to the Backpack Kid&#39;s &quot;floss&quot; dance, and we have ourselves not just the biggest game of the year, but a cultural phenomenon that&#39;s responsible for most of the gaming disorder cases in recent memory.</p><p>It would be great to talk to the creators and learn how much they studied about what humans and our brain&#39;s reward pathways crave and what&rsquo;s most addictive to us!</p><p><strong>What are some good tactics to regulate your child&rsquo;s video game activity?</strong></p><p>First and foremost, it&rsquo;s important to manage gaming behaviorally. As a parent or caregiver, the main thing is to ensure strong supervision, particularly for younger children, and to monitor what your child is exposed to. If you can, play the game with your kids or stay with them while they play, so it becomes a bonding activity, and you can also discuss the game&rsquo;s content.</p><p>We should generally discourage kids younger than 2 years old from screen time, though the occasional Baby First program or FaceTime or Skype call is not going to be detrimental. Yes, grandparents everywhere can breathe a collective sigh of relief! Preschool-age kids and younger, in particular, model what they observe, so they should not play games with gratuitous adult content &mdash; including excessive violence, sexuality, substances, criminality, or profanity. You can check the Entertainment Software Rating Board age and content ratings assigned to select suitable games.</p><p>Another recommendation is to keep game systems in the common room instead of the bedroom, so it&rsquo;s easier to supervise the kids and they&rsquo;re less likely to sneak in more time playing. Kids that have TVs in their room tend to spend about 1.5 hours per day more on their screens than those that don&rsquo;t! If your child tries to sneak extra time gaming, you may need to unplug and physically remove the TV and game systems, but please don&#39;t give in and not follow through with enforcing the rules and consequences for the limits you&rsquo;ve set.</p><p>You can use gaming and overall screen time as a reward for completing chores and homework, performing hygiene, physical activity, practicing music or arts, and other adaptive behaviors you want to reinforce. Likewise, taking away your child&#39;s gaming or screen time may be a suitable punishment when he or she does not meet your clear expectations of behavior. A good rule of thumb is don&#39;t take away prosocial activities like sports, music, arts, or volunteering as a punishment, while gaming and total screen time lend themselves nicely to be negotiable for behavioral modification.</p><p><strong>How can parents set limits on gaming without creating conflict with their child?</strong></p><p>Set clear expectations for your child in terms of sleeping, eating, hygiene, physical activity, chores, education and employment. Then use gaming as a reward he or she can earn for meeting these expectations, as a fun activity performed in moderation to de-stress. Note that when you reduce gaming time, you need to replace it with something else &mdash; perhaps special time as a family &mdash; riding bikes, going to the park or beach, or playing a board game or puzzle together. These activities can be as fun as video games but of course healthier in terms of social, physical, mental and creative engagement.</p><p><strong>How is video game addiction treated?</strong></p><p>Like any addiction that hijacks the brain&#39;s reward pathway, it&rsquo;s not easy for most gamers to just quit playing cold turkey. In treatment, we seek to understand what video games the gamer is interested in and why. For instance, online roleplaying games like <em>World of Warcraft</em> allow you to interact with a community of like-minded gamers and explore a cosmic fantasy world. In games like <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>The Sims</em>, you&#39;re allowed the freedom and creativity to build almost anything your heart desires, and you set your own goals with no end in sight. What does the gamer&#39;s game of choice tell you about what he or she might be craving?</p><p>We typically utilize a form of cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, the psychotherapeutic approach which is considered the gold standard for children and adolescents in treating other mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, and disruptive behavior disorders.</p><p>With video game addiction, we monitor the thoughts and feelings the child associates with gaming. Just as people self-medicate with drugs and alcohol, they may do so with video games, so we want to identify any underlying causes for the gaming addiction. For example, is the child gaming excessively to cope with untreated depression, anxiety, or ADHD? CBT and possibly medication may greatly help such gamers regain and maximize their level of functioning.</p><p>We work with the parents to develop and set clear expectations, rules and consequences for their children. For instance, how much time for playing video games is allowed and what needs to be done first? If the parents&rsquo; expectations are met and rules are followed, a reasonable reward may be 30 additional minutes of gaming time this evening. Failing to meet expectations or follow rules, on the other hand, may result in 30 minutes less of getting to play.</p><p><strong>Can playing video games be beneficial?</strong></p><p>In moderation, video games have been found to have some positive effects: improving hand-eye coordination, reaction time, creativity, visual-spatial and problem-solving capacities; increasing the ability to pay attention while filtering out distractions; improving reading comprehension for those with dyslexia; sparking a child&#39;s interest in the social sciences, as many games use historical events and maps to drive their stories; and curbing cravings for overeating or using substances &mdash; though not surprisingly, the more time kids or adults spend sedentary in front of screens, the more likely they are to be overweight or obese. Video game technologies like virtual reality have helped people recover from PTSD and get over phobias by providing exposure therapy, as well as helping substance users deal with triggering moments.</p><p>There are some educational games that can make learning more interesting or fun, such as <em>Reader Rabbit</em>, <em>The Magic School Bus,&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;LeapFrog Leapster</em>.</p><p>Playing video games can certainly be a relaxing or distracting coping skill to reduce stress, with one major study tracking gamers&#39; heart rates over six months showing certain video games were associated with reducing the adrenaline response by over 50 percent. Experiencing the range of pleasant and unpleasant emotions in a gaming context has been found to help people regulate emotions, learn to cope with various situations, and challenge themselves. Some studies have shown that kids who play moderate amounts of games &mdash; less than an hour per day &mdash; have fewer emotional issues and are more likely to help others than kids who don&#39;t play games. Just about every one of my child and adolescent patients lists video games as one of his or her coping skills and hobbies, while only a handful meet the criteria for gaming disorder.</p><p>Also, while video game addiction can often be socially isolating in terms of real-world relationships, gaming offers a new form of socializing in which players interact and collaborate in various problem-solving endeavors, which can certainly have benefits in terms of developing social connections &mdash; particularly for those with autism. I have had many patients with autism spectrum disorder or social anxiety disorder who thoroughly enjoy discussing with others online and in-person about the video games they love, even as they are struggling to communicate elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Some physicians have responded to the WHO&rsquo;s announcement by saying there isn&rsquo;t enough research to make gaming disorder an official diagnosis. Others say it&rsquo;s about time. How do you feel?</strong></p><p>Diagnoses provide a language to name and talk about the problem. Video game addiction is an emerging area of research that certainly warrants more studies. Gaming disorder has not been endorsed as an official diagnosis by the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association or American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. However, internet gaming disorder is included as a &ldquo;Condition for Further Study&rdquo; with a request for additional research in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the APA in 2013.</p><p>In addition to further research, if including the gaming disorder diagnosis in the 11th edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) leads to increased recognition and treatment of those who have been gaming excessively and excluding daily activities and interests, it&#39;s a positive. It&rsquo;s important to recognize if any behavior, not just gaming, is being performed excessively or compulsively and hinders the person&#39;s overall level of functioning, and to not hesitate to seek help from your primary care doctor or a behavioral health specialist to attain the right treatment. &ldquo;Everything in moderation&rdquo; is generally a healthy philosophy.</p><p><br></p><p><em>If you are concerned about how your child&rsquo;s video gaming is affecting them, make an appointment with a&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/primary-care/children-and-teens-health\" target=\"_blank\"><em>pediatrician</em></a><em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\"><em>behavioral health specialist</em></a><em>&nbsp;to find solutions.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Idra acts like any healthy, rambunctious 5-year-old boy. As his mom boosts him onto the exam table, he tugs at the corners of his mouth and sticks his tongue out to make a funny face at her. When his nurse draws blood from his arm, he watches wide-eyed as the tube turns red and lets out a long &ldquo;wow!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s one of many words he has picked up since arriving in the U.S.</p><p>Iderbayar Ichinkhorloo, who goes by Idra, traveled from Mongolia with his family to be treated at <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/cancer/blood-disorders\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville</a> and Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville. He was diagnosed with severe aplastic anemia in April, leading to intense fatigue, uncontrolled bleeding, fever and a high risk of infection.</p><p><strong>A rare, life-threatening condition</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Aplastic anemia is thought to be an autoimmune disease where the patient makes antibodies against his or her own bone marrow,&rdquo; said pediatric hematologist/oncologist <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-hematologist-oncologist/dr-eric-sandler-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Sandler, MD,</a> also director of neuro-oncology at Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know why children get this, and it is pretty rare.</p><p>&ldquo;The result is that their bodies can&rsquo;t make the different parts of the blood. Idra&rsquo;s red cell count was low, so he needed regular blood transfusions. His platelets were low and he had nose bleeds as a result of his blood not being able to clot. And his white blood cell count was low, which makes it hard to fight infection.&rdquo;</p><p>When Dr. Sandler met Idra at Mothers&rsquo; and Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia&rsquo;s capital city, the boy had been hospitalized for two months with high fevers. The only hospital in the country with a pediatric hematology and oncology team, Mother&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Hospital has benefited from the resources provided each year by Dr. Sandler and a team of specialists, who travel to Ulaanbaatar to provide education to the pediatric oncologists there. The mission is funded by The Jonathan Soud Legacy Endowment for Global Medical Care through the Baptist Health Foundation.</p><p>In Idra&rsquo;s case, treatments for aplastic anemia simply weren&rsquo;t available at home. Dr. Sandler explains that because Mongolia is relatively small, only a very limited number of drugs are imported into the country. The anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) treatment Idra needed wasn&rsquo;t one of them.</p><p>&ldquo;Since aplastic anemia causes the body&rsquo;s immune system to destroy its own bone marrow where blood is made, ATG destroys those immune cells which are attacking the bone marrow,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;My son was seeing a specialist in the hospital for two months when we met Dr. Sandler and his nurse Dana Collins,&rdquo; said Baigal Bayarsaikhan, Idra&rsquo;s mother, through a translator at Dr. Sandler&rsquo;s Nemours office. &ldquo;Treatment for this disease does not exist in Mongolia and we did not know what we should do. We introduced our son to Dr. Sandler. We asked for help and if there was an opportunity to get treatment for this in the U.S. After he saw the problem with our happy child, he said, &lsquo;We can help.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>When a child is diagnosed with severe aplastic anemia, their risk of dying from complications of the disease increases by 20 percent every year. After five years, only 20 percent of children with this diagnosis are still alive. But with a bone marrow transplant or ATG therapy, most children can be cured.</p><p>&ldquo;His blood cell counts remained low and he was getting blood transfusions multiple times a week,&rdquo; said Dr. Sandler. &ldquo;His doctors were very discouraged because they have no effective treatment for this disease. The family didn&rsquo;t have the funds to come to the U.S. and get treatment, so Michael Aubin, Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital president, agreed to take this on as a charitable case. That means there was no cost for medical care for the family. They were only responsible for providing transportation to come.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Treatment begins</strong></p><p>Once Idra and his parents landed in the U.S., he was admitted to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital for his ATG treatment. He received the therapy over the course of a week, charming everyone who helped care for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Unless there is a bone marrow donor available, we try the ATG treatment first. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve done with Idra. Typically it can take up to three months before we see the final results of this treatment,&rdquo; Dr. Sandler explained.</p><p>Since his treatment, Idra has been undergoing blood tests twice a week to check the results. He and his mother returned home to Mongolia on August 4. Dr. Sandler is tracking Idra&rsquo;s progress and working closely, albeit remotely, with the boy&rsquo;s doctors in Ulaanbaatar, who are still checking his blood cell counts twice weekly.</p><p>&ldquo;They will continue to look at his blood cell counts to see if he needs fewer transfusions and if his white blood cell counts are coming up. We&rsquo;re also going to check his bone marrow and compare it to the sample we took when he first arrived to see if it is recovering,&rdquo; said Dr. Sandler. &ldquo;He will continue on an oral medicine that works with the ATG for a year or so. Hopefully, this therapy will work and he&rsquo;ll go on to have a normal and healthy life. I don&rsquo;t think this has all slowed him down one bit.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Back home and feeling better</strong></p><p>&ldquo;We are very, very, very happy,&rdquo; said Bayarsaikhan. &ldquo;We are glad to have come here and to have met all of these nurses and doctors and for treatment at the hospital and the clinic. Our family would like to thank Dr. Sandler and everyone from the bottom of our hearts.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Sandler will be visiting Mongolia again in the summer of 2019, but doesn&rsquo;t expect to see Idra back in the hospital when he goes.</p><p>&ldquo;This family from Mongolia wouldn&rsquo;t have any other options without this mission funded by the Soud family&rsquo;s endowment at Baptist Health Foundation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clearly very rewarding for us, and our ultimate goal is to make all of these treatments available in Mongolia.&rdquo;</p><p><br></p><p><em>Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.nemours.org/locations/florida-pediatric-specialty-care-jacksonville.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>nemours.org</em></a></p>",

Consuming more gluten as a protective factor against diabetes is simply an overreach.</p><p>&ldquo;When the study came out, I got a lot of questions from patients asking me about this,&rdquo; said Dr. Gonzalez, a family physician with Baptist Primary care at 900 Beach Blvd. who specializes in wellness and also, Type 2 diabetes. &ldquo;But, I think they should take this out of their heads, the idea that they&rsquo;re going to eat more gluten and they&rsquo;re not going to get diabetes. I would focus more on exercise and maintaining a balanced diet.&rdquo;</p><p>On the other hand, many people who eliminate gluten from their diets aren&rsquo;t really getting health benefits either, he said. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The march towards gluten-free&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Gluten is a protein found in cereal grains such as wheat, rye and barley. It&rsquo;s the substance that gives dough its elasticity. Most people associate gluten with bread and other baked goods, but gluten may also show up in some not-so-obvious places such as bouillon cubes, hot dogs and beer.</p><p>People with celiac disease &mdash; about 1 percent of the population &mdash; must avoid gluten. For them, gluten damages the lining of the small intestine, causing digestive problems.</p><p>But many more people limit glutens in their diets, saying it simply makes them feel better.</p><p>Gluten-free substitutes now appear in grocery stores, restaurants, and even ballparks. About 30 percent of Americans say they are actively trying to remove gluten from their diets.</p><p>Dr. Gonzalez said that&rsquo;s unnecessary.</p><p><strong>A fad diet</strong></p><p>There&rsquo;s a difference between people who need to avoid gluten and people who don&rsquo;t. People with celiac disease won&rsquo;t be able to tolerate foods with gluten at all. They may have abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Doctors can positively diagnose celiac by doing a biopsy of the intestine. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Usually you&rsquo;ll find celiac disease in younger women in their mid-20s and 30s, and sometimes in men,&rdquo; Dr. Gonzalez said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re coming in at 60 years old, it&rsquo;s unlikely. You would have been diagnosed way before then.&rdquo;</p><p>Some people don&rsquo;t have celiac disease, but still have symptoms showing they are sensitive to gluten. Usually, it&rsquo;s a diagnosis of exclusion, after other causes have been ruled out.</p><p>There are many more people who can tolerate gluten, but who have adopted a gluten-free diet because they believe it&rsquo;s healthier.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made it such fad,&rdquo; Dr. Gonzalez said. &ldquo;About half the people who avoid gluten probably don&rsquo;t have any sensitivity to it.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Not a silver bullet for diabetes</strong></p><p>As some people were advocating the health benefits of going gluten-free, others were wondering if there were health risks. Gluten-free foods typically have less dietary fiber and micronutrients than foods with gluten.</p><p>A Harvard study released in March 2017 suggested a correlation between low-gluten diets and increased risk for type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;</p><p>Researchers studying nearly 200,000 people over a 30-year period found those who had consumed the most gluten had 13 percent less risk of developing Type 2 diabetes than those who had consumed the least.</p><p>Dr. Gonzalez cautioned against assuming too much from those results. The gluten-diabetes connection was not the original purpose of the study, but instead, more of an incidental finding.</p><p>&ldquo;Even the people who did the study said it needed a lot more research,&rdquo; Dr. Gonzalez said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any doctor would be confident enough to tell a patient to increase their gluten to prevent diabetes.&rdquo;</p><p>The cereal fiber which contains gluten does promote the digestion of glucose and carbohydrates. &nbsp;But lots of foods have fiber, he said. And eating more fiber is only one part of a larger chain reaction of things you need to do to prevent diabetes.&nbsp;</p><p><em>If you are concerned about your health and wellness, or specifically type 2 diabetes prevention, and you don&rsquo;t currently have a primary care physician, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Primary Care</em></a><em>&nbsp;to find a doctor near you.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>July 25, 2018, wasn&rsquo;t the first time Orange Park&rsquo;s Hale family faced their worst nightmare, even though Karina and Kurt Hale had just learned that two of their five children, Seth and Jaden, had been in a horrible car crash and their survival was far from assured.</p><p>Just four-and-a-half years ago, when Seth was 7, he was diagnosed with cancer at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital after a visit to the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-clay-medical-campus\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Emergency Center at Baptist Clay</a>. Pediatric emergency medicine physician <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-emergency-medicine-specialist/dr-matthew-locklair-md\">Matthew Locklair, MD</a>, with Emergency Resource Group (ERG) transferred Seth directly to the hematology/oncology unit at Wolfson Children&#39;s, where testing revealed the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which commonly has a survival rate of up to 90 percent with chemotherapy treatment.</p><p>Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care pediatric hematologist/oncologist <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-hematologist-oncologist/dr-manisha-bansal-md\" target=\"_blank\">Manisha Bansal, MD</a>, ordered genetic testing in order to customize Seth&rsquo;s treatment and to rule out any other conditions that could affect his outcome.</p><p>To the Hales&rsquo; dismay, genetic testing showed Seth&rsquo;s leukemia cells were hypodiploid, a chromosomal condition that only worsened his ALL prognosis and dropped his survival rate down to 40 percent with standard chemotherapy. &ldquo;Dr. Bansal held my hand and cried with me when she told me,&rdquo; Karina said.</p><p>Chemotherapy and radiation treatment would not be enough to give him the best chance at a cure. &ldquo;The <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/cancer\" target=\"_blank\">oncology team</a> had already studied to know the best chance Seth had to beat his cancer was a bone marrow transplant at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, so we changed gears from just chemo to pursue a transplant,&rdquo; said Karina.</p><p>Their next challenge was finding a bone marrow donor who matched Seth. The odds of finding a marrow donor match within the family &ndash; what Seth would need to have the best chance at survival &ndash; were low. Each of their children had only a 25 percent chance of being a match for their brother. Still, the whole family &ndash; Karina and Kurt, older brother Jaden and the Hales&rsquo; three-year-old twins, Erik and Lydia &ndash; were tested.</p><p>To their amazement, the twins &ndash; despite being fraternal rather than identical &ndash; proved to both be 100-percent matches for Seth.</p><p><strong>&lsquo;So much life in him, he had some to share&rsquo;</strong></p><p>Karina and Kurt had a dilemma. Which of their twins would they choose to be Seth&rsquo;s donor, which would involve anesthesia and an extraction procedure in the OR, not without risk?</p><p>&ldquo;Turns out, it was easy,&rdquo; Karina said. &ldquo;We felt like Erik was so full of life, stronger and bigger than his sister. And he had so much life to share.&rdquo;</p><p>Erik had his bone marrow extraction on July 29, 2014. Kurt said, &ldquo;Within hours of his procedure, Erik was playing basketball in his room. He didn&rsquo;t even have Tylenol. He bounced right back.&rdquo;</p><p>Erik&rsquo;s bone marrow was healthy and plentiful and was transfused into Seth the same day.</p><p>Only three weeks later, Seth was back home, where he faced 100 days of isolation to protect him from infection while his immune system returned. After that, life returned to normal for the Hale family, with Karina homeschooling their four kids, Kurt running the family business, and the whole family busy at their church, Hibernia Baptist.</p><p><strong>Family beach day turns into a struggle for survival</strong></p><p>&ldquo;My sister was visiting from Michigan, and we&rsquo;re beach bums, so we decided to have a beach day in St. Augustine,&rdquo; said Karina, recalling that sunny day. &ldquo;Jaden had a tummy ache and wanted to stay home, but I didn&rsquo;t want to leave him alone, so I told him we would get him something to settle his stomach and we would just lie on the beach.&rdquo;</p><p>Karina&rsquo;s father Daniel King took the older boys, Jaden and Seth, in his car, while Karina and her sister took the little ones in a separate vehicle.</p><p>Karina remembered: &ldquo;We were 10 minutes ahead of them, and had just crossed over the Shands Bridge in Green Cove Springs when I got a call from Dad. He said, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve been in an accident.&rsquo; I asked him how the boys were, and he said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&#39; because he was in shock or had a concussion.&rdquo;</p><p>Traffic was backed up so Karina got out of her car and ran toward the crash scene at the intersection of US 17 and 16. &ldquo;I saw the second ambulance pull away and I couldn&rsquo;t get in there with them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They were already on their way to the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/emergency\" target=\"_blank\">[Pediatric] Trauma Center&nbsp;</a>at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.&rdquo;</p><p>Karina was horrified by what she saw at the collision scene. A semi-truck had plowed into the passenger side of her father&rsquo;s car. It seemed hard to imagine how anyone could survive such a terrible crash. She had little time to process that, though, and got in her car to pick Kurt up and head to the hospital.</p><p>Kurt said, &ldquo;We had no idea how the boys were. Were they just shaken up? Were they OK or not OK? Waiting for Karina to pick me up seemed like forever, even though it was actually about 25-30 minutes with traffic. I saw the ambulances carrying our sons go by while I was waiting for her.&rdquo;</p><p>The Hales prayed. &ldquo;I told God, &lsquo;I know you gave me these boys and that you love them even more than I do,&rsquo;&quot; said Karina. &quot;I prayed that we would get to keep both of them, but knew that if this was their last day, they would be with Him. That&rsquo;s the way I got through that drive.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>True</strong><strong>&nbsp;extent of injuries discovered at&nbsp;</strong><strong>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Pediatric Trauma Center</strong></p><p>When Karina and Kurt arrived at the hospital, they went to the Trauma Center, where Jaden and Seth had adjoining rooms so pediatric emergency medicine doctors <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-emergency-medicine-specialist/dr-suman-mayer-md\" target=\"_blank\">Suman Mayer, MD</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-emergency-medicine-specialist/dr-brian-gilligan-md\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Gilligan, MD</a>, both with ERG, plus the rest of the trauma team, could work on both critically injured boys.&nbsp;</p><p>Kurt said, &ldquo;There was blood everywhere. Seth looked visibly worse, but Jaden actually turned out to be more critical due to internal injuries. Jaden started seizing and they told us they had to get a CT scan right away.&rdquo;</p><p>The scan showed that Jaden&rsquo;s skull was fractured in the front, over the right eye, and it had punctured his brain, leading to a bruise and the brain and internal bleeding. Pediatric neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-neurosurgeon/dr-nathan-ranalli-md\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Ranalli, MD</a>, and craniofacial surgeon <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-oral-surgeon/dr-barry-steinberg-md\" target=\"_blank\">Barry Steinberg, MD</a>, both with the UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville, were called in.</p><p>&ldquo;After his seizure, Jaden&rsquo;s mental status deteriorated and he had to be intubated,&rdquo; Dr. Ranalli said. &ldquo;Given the head CT finding of a depressed skull fracture causing compression of his brain, emergency surgery was indicated to relieve the pressure and repair the defect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The nature and severity of Jaden&rsquo;s injuries required we remove the back wall of his frontal sinus (next to his brain) and close its communication with his nose; these are usually connected by an opening between the two but in Jaden&rsquo;s case, it was closed off,&rdquo; explained Dr. Steinberg. &ldquo;After that, we reconstructed his forehead using his fractured bone and titanium metal mesh.&rdquo;</p><p>Thankfully, the procedure went well and Jaden&rsquo;s intracranial pressure returned to normal. However, Jaden&rsquo;s ordeal wasn&rsquo;t over. At the end of brain surgery, Nemours pediatric anesthesiologist <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-anesthesiologist/dr-fernando-zayas-bazan-md\" target=\"_blank\">Fernandez Zayas-Bazan, MD</a>, noted that Jaden&rsquo;s blood pressure had dropped dramatically, leading physicians to suspect Jaden had an abdominal injury that wasn&rsquo;t visible when he first arrived at the Trauma Center.</p><p>After an ultrasound showed blood in Jaden&#39;s abdomen, Nemours pediatric trauma surgeon <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-surgeon/dr-nicholas-poulos-md\" target=\"_blank\">Nicholas Poulos, MD</a>, performed exploratory surgery. &ldquo;Jaden&rsquo;s muscle layers in his stomach had separated in the accident, causing a small blood vessel to very slowly leak blood into his abdomen,&rdquo; explained Dr. Poulos. &ldquo;I had to perform a stomach degloving procedure, in which I reattached the muscle layers, and stopped the bleeding by cauterizing the blood vessel.&rdquo;</p><p>Back on the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), the Hales waited anxiously for news of Jaden while caregivers cleaned glass out of Seth&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;He got 18 stitches on his forehead, inside his nose, and on his chin,&rdquo; said Kurt. &ldquo;He also had a bruise and bleeding on his brain but didn&rsquo;t require surgery. We sat with him for hours and hours while Jaden was being treated in the OR.&rdquo;</p><p>Following Jaden&rsquo;s surgery, Dr. Poulos came to talk to the Hales. &ldquo;He said he could tell us what happened, but that would be a lot of medical terms, so it would be better for him to show us,&rdquo; said Kurt. &ldquo;It was good he did that because we could see exactly what we were dealing with because he walked us through it.&rdquo;</p><p>While Seth was doing OK, Jaden was still in critical condition. Kurt and Karina relied on their faith. &ldquo;It can be easy to have faith when your kids are healthy and life is good,&rdquo; Kurt said. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re faced with losing the dearest things to you, you learn the depth of your faith and the strength God gives.&rdquo;</p><p>While Seth went home from the hospital only four days after the accident, Jaden remained sedated, on a ventilator and with a feeding tube in the PICU. Night three into his hospital stay, he had improved enough to be taken off the ventilator.</p><p>While he has a long road to recovery ahead, Jaden was well enough to be transferred to a regular floor at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s on July 30.</p><p>&ldquo;The first thing he said when he woke up was, &lsquo;Daddy, you have the weirdest smile,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Kurt. &ldquo;We knew our quick, witty and smart Jaden was back.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Home to hospital to home again</strong></p><p>Jaden was discharged from Wolfson Children&#39;s on August 12 &ndash; huge progress considering his condition just a couple of weeks before.</p><p>&ldquo;Seth is completely better, his stitches are already out and he looks amazing!&rdquo; said Karina.</p><p>Now a family of seven after the birth of baby girl Norah last year, the Hales are grateful for the way the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital team has surrounded them with care for the last few years. &ldquo;This hospital is like our family,&rdquo; said Karina. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t take our kids anywhere else.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Poulos, who serves as medical director of Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Pediatric Trauma Center, said: &ldquo;Jaden has a long road ahead of him as he recovers from his injuries, but he is healing well. It is so important for a child to have a lot of support, and Jaden is lucky to have such a big, caring family in his corner. Having a Pediatric Trauma Center that brings together all of these medical and surgical specialties, in one location, is also critically important when minutes matter and when a delay in care can change a child&#39;s life.&quot;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Babyproofing your home may not seem urgent &mdash; babies aren&rsquo;t mobile for months after birth, so some parents hope to keep their home the way it is until absolutely necessary. But in reality, any time before your due date is exactly the right time to begin babyproofing.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s scary to think that babies younger than 1 year old have a rate of unintentional, injury-related death equal to that of teen drivers!&rdquo; said Cynthia Dennis, RN, coordinator of <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/safe-kids-northeast-florida\" target=\"_blank\">Safe Kids Northeast Florida</a>. &quot;But learning a few key safety tips at each stage of your baby&rsquo;s development, such as creating safe sleep environments and actively supervising your child around water, is a great way to ensure that your baby will grow up curious and active, but safe.&rdquo;</p><p>As babies develop, they begin learning and exploring rapidly. They may decide to tug on the oven door before you realize they&rsquo;re learning to pull up and stand, which can lead to a serious injury.</p><p>As new parents, you deserve the peace of mind offered by a babyproofed home. Here are some tips for each area of the house:</p><p><strong>Living room</strong></p><ul><li>Cover the sharp corners of coffee tables.</li><li>Use childproof baby gates to block off unsafe areas, and install them at the top and bottom of staircases to prevent falls.</li><li>Secure unstable or top-heavy furniture to the wall using brackets, braces or wall straps. As your baby learns to pull up and stand, these could become tipping hazards.</li><li>Check your TV&rsquo;s stability. Some flat screens are wobbly when their stands are bumped. Mount flat-screen TVs on the wall to prevent them falling off of the stand.</li></ul><p><strong>Kitchen</strong></p><ul><li>Install an oven lock so your baby can&rsquo;t pull the door open, and buy covers to prevent tinkering with the knobs on gas stoves.</li><li>Cook using the back burner of your stove and turn pot handles away from the edge. Place hot foods and liquids away from the edge of counters and tables so your baby or toddler can&rsquo;t pull them down.</li><li>Place childproof locking mechanisms on cabinets where you store detergents, laundry pods and cleaning products. While many people store these items under the kitchen sink, move them to a higher place that is not eye-level or within reach for small children.</li><li>Keep sharp objects, like kitchen knives, in a childproof cabinet or drawer.</li></ul><p><strong>Bedrooms</strong></p><ul><li>Install stops on dresser drawers to keep them from being pulled all the way out. If your baby opens multiple drawers, the weight becomes unbalanced and the dresser can tip over.</li><li>Take safe sleep precautions, like removing blankets, bumpers and toys from your baby&rsquo;s crib. All your child needs is a firm mattress and fitted sheet.</li><li>Place your baby&rsquo;s crib and other furniture away from windows and blinds. When strings or cords are within your baby&rsquo;s reach, they are a strangulation risk.</li></ul><p><strong>Bathrooms</strong></p><ul><li>Keep a water thermometer near where you bathe your baby and always check the bath temperature every time. The right temperature for baby&rsquo;s bath is no more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit.</li><li>Set the thermostat on your water heater to 120 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent scalding as your baby gets older and may try to turn the bath knobs. Cover tub knobs and faucets with silicone covers to prevent burns.</li><li>Use nonslip rubber bath mats.</li><li>Keep razors, scissors, nail files and sharp objects out of baby&rsquo;s reach.</li><li>Make sure all medications are stored out of reach in childproof containers.</li></ul><p><strong>Throughout the house</strong></p><ul><li>Lock all windows and consider installing window guards to prevent children from opening and falling out of a window.</li><li>Use covers on all electrical sockets.</li><li>Search your home for any remotes or gadgets containing coin-sized lithium batteries. Secure the battery compartments with tape and keep them out of your baby&rsquo;s sight and reach.</li><li>Unplug and store any items that heat up quickly, like irons, hair dryers or hair straighteners. This will prevent baby from pushing buttons and accidentally getting burned.</li><li>Get into the habit of scanning the floor for small items that could cause choking if your baby decides to investigate them with his mouth. Developing babies learn by exploring tastes and textures. Even if your baby doesn&#39;t always behave this way, once he begins teething you may find he&#39;s more likely to put new things into his mouth to help soothe pain.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t leave your baby unattended on a bed, changing table or other high surfaces.</li><li>If you have a pool, install a fence and gate with an alarm to make sure your baby can&rsquo;t wander near the water unsupervised.</li></ul><p><em>For more information about keeping infants, toddlers and older children safe at home, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/safe-kids-northeast-florida\" target=\"_blank\"><em>wolfsonchildrens.com/safekids</em></a><em>.</em>&nbsp;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>For many, the holidays are a wonderful opportunity to take the pace of our hectic lives down a notch, and enjoy the company of friends and family. These times serve not only as a way to recharge, but to reconnect with the ones we love as well. As parents, one of the greatest things about this time of year is the time getting to spend with your children creating memories, and instilling traditions they will carry on when they have families of their own.</p><p>Whether you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or something else, there&rsquo;s usually food involved, which means you&rsquo;re going to be in the kitchen. While you&rsquo;re there, why not include your little ones in the fun? Kids love to measure out ingredients, mix them up and, of course, taste-test, so it&rsquo;s the perfect time to enlist their help while imparting basic lessons about cooking. And believe it or not, many of these activities also provide learning and developmental opportunities that go well beyond food preparation.</p><p>&ldquo;You can use this time in the kitchen to work with your child on counting skills, color sorting, and understanding basic measurements, which all help develop fine motor skills,&rdquo; said Jodi Ervin, RD, a registered dietitian with <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also a great chance to talk about nutrition and healthy eating.&rdquo;</p><p>Making something like a healthy holiday trail mix together utilizes all of the above. From measuring out the ingredients, allowing him or her to count out small items like M&amp;Ms&reg;, separating out the green and red ones into a separate pile, and pouring them into small containers helps hone manual dexterity, which is the coordination between the small muscles in the hands and fingers with those in the eyes. These activities also make a child feel more at home in the kitchen environment, which is important later when they are off cooking on their own someday.</p><p>&ldquo;With microwaveable items and take-out food so readily available, children today aren&rsquo;t learning basic skills in the kitchen anymore that one day lead to better eating habits as adults,&rdquo; said Ervin. &ldquo;Habits form at an early age and with childhood obesity on the rise, it&rsquo;s really important to get them involved in the kitchen when they&rsquo;re little, and to make it fun.&rdquo;</p><p>The best time to plan these kitchen sessions, she added, is after a good nap when your child is well rested. It&rsquo;s also a wonderful distraction from the television and video games. Every now and then, veering off the healthy path and making a treat like cookies is OK, too. After all, holidays and cookies do go hand-in-hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Teaching them how to make a recipe that&rsquo;s been in the family for years is a great way to build tradition,&rdquo; said Ervin.</p><p><strong>Healthy Holiday Trail Mix</strong></p><ul><li>2 cups Cheerios&trade; (plain or multigrain), Rice/Wheat Chex&trade;, or Kashi&reg; GOLEAN cereal</li><li>&frac12; cup whole grain pretzel sticks or squares</li><li>&frac14; cup raisins, dried blueberries or dried cranberries</li><li>&frac14; cup sunflower or pumpkin seeds</li><li>&frac14; cup almonds, cashews or walnuts</li><li>Sprinkle in mini-M&amp;Ms&reg; or chocolate chips</li></ul><p>Mix everything and portion into &frac12;-cup servings.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>You know how it goes. You&rsquo;re eating healthy -- in fact, you&rsquo;ve been doing so for five hours in a row! But then, hunger strikes with a vengeance, making it tempting to reach for whatever is easiest. What&rsquo;s an aspiring healthy eater to do?</p><p>We talked to Anna Stallard, a clinical dietitian with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>, to see what she does when faced with roadblocks to healthy choices.</p><p>&ldquo;My No. 1 piece of advice is to plan ahead. With unhealthy options everywhere you turn, eating healthy won&rsquo;t just happen,&rdquo; said Stallard.</p><p>Her solution: Always have healthy snacks on hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Cut up fresh fruit and veggies and place them in small plastic containers or plastic bags so you can grab them whenever,&rdquo; she recommended.</p><p>Whole-grain snacks like popcorn and select crackers or chips are good, too, but check the labels first. Place healthy snacks where you will see them first &ndash; on the first row of the fridge or at the front of the cabinet. Conversely, put unhealthy snacks out of reach so it&rsquo;s harder to get to them.</p><p>Even for those who plan ahead, there are always food dangers lurking. Here are Stallard&rsquo;s answers on how to combat temptation.</p><p><strong>Q. What can I do if I&rsquo;m on a road trip and the only options are fast food?</strong><br>A. It&rsquo;s not impossible to make good choices at the drive-through. Opt for a chicken sandwich rather that beef, which has more fat than chicken. To save more fat and empty calories, ask for it without mayo and cheese and forget the fries. Many fast-food places offer salads and fruit now. Chili can be a healthy option as well.</p><p><strong>Q. I missed breakfast and now I am starving. Can I grab a breakfast bar?</strong><br>A. Yes, but check the nutrition label first. Many breakfast bars are high in sugar, so look for one with less than 10 grams. One high in protein (at least 10 grams) and fiber (at least 5grams) will help you feel full for longer.</p><p><strong>Q. What if it&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s birthday in the office and there&rsquo;s a delicious cake staring me in the face?</strong><br>A. What I do is weigh the options. If it&rsquo;s one of my very favorites and it&rsquo;s worth it to me, I go ahead and have a small piece and then get right back on track and eat nutritiously for the rest of the day.</p><p><strong>Q. I am going out to a restaurant tonight. Any tips?</strong><br>A. Portion control is the main thing. Many restaurants serve meals that are two or three times the recommended serving size. Ask for a to-go container and take the rest home. Also, beware of high-calorie salads. Those with fried chicken, high-fat dressing, cheese and nuts can add up to more than 1,000 calories, not to mention an overload of sodium and sugar.</p><p><strong>Q. What should I do if I really crave something sweet after dinner?</strong><br>A. Have something small &ndash; I allow myself to have a couple of small pieces of dark chocolate after dinner. They have fiber and antioxidants, which may prevent or delay some types of cell damage.</p><p><strong>Q. I&rsquo;m going to a party and there will be lots of decadent food. What&rsquo;s the best strategy?</strong><br>A. Limiting your alcohol intake will help greatly because it contains empty calories, and it lowers your inhibitions, making overeating easier. Eat a healthy meal before you go to the party and stick to the healthy snacks like fruits, veggies, and whole-grain crackers and chips. To add flavor, dip veggies in fresh salsa, hummus or guacamole, all of which are high in nutrients.<br><br><strong>Q. Any final words of advice?</strong><br>A. Have a game plan in place &ndash; like these tips I&rsquo;ve mentioned&ndash;so you know what to do before you are faced with food pitfalls. The more you plan, the better you will do.</p><p><em>For more information on avoiding food pitfalls in your diet, you can make an appointment with a wellness coach, a free service offered through the Baptist Y Healthy Living Center, by calling 904.202.CARE (2273).

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>One in five American children between age 2 and 19 are overweight or obese. In a recent study published in the journal Pediatrics, researchers found that obesity rates have been steadily climbing since 1999. Starting in 2015, the most significant increase in obesity has happened among children 2 to 5 years old.</p><p>Madeline Joseph, MD, medical director of the <a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1525194847/WolfsonChildrens/About/health-and-wellness/WCH_1535_PedWeightMgmt_flyer.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">UF Health Pediatric Weight Management Center at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a> and chief of the division of pediatric bariatrics at the UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville, sees the results of the study reflected in her own patients. However, she says there isn&rsquo;t much data about why this increase is happening.</p><p>&ldquo;I would say it&rsquo;s a combination of the nutrition we&rsquo;re taking in and our lifestyles,&rdquo; said Dr. Joseph. &ldquo;The amount of time kids spend playing outdoors today is negligible &mdash; the free play that used to be part of life doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore. Serving sizes have also increased substantially in the last 50 years. We&rsquo;re used to large serving sizes of food and drinks, and we&rsquo;ve forgotten what an appropriately sized meal looks like.&rdquo;</p><p>UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville pediatric cardiologist <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-cardiologist/dr-shawyntee-mayo-md\" target=\"_blank\">Shawyntee Mayo, MD</a>, also cares for patients with the UF Health Pediatric Weight Management Center. She added that not only has the quantity of our food changed but so has the quality.</p><p>&ldquo;Today, we have more screen time and less physical activity to expend calories,&rdquo; Dr. &nbsp;Mayo said. &ldquo;The quality of our food has shifted toward more processed, high-sugar foods and fast food as opposed to consuming fresh and natural foods,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>The earlier in life a child becomes obese, the sooner they may be affected by its associated health conditions: type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, high cholesterol, osteoarthritis and sleep disorders.</p><p>&ldquo;Studies have shown that changes that occur in the coronary arteries begin in childhood. It&rsquo;s never too early to be concerned about plaque formation, which is the accumulation of cholesterol, fat and calcium that can narrow the arteries,&rdquo; said Dr. Mayo.</p><p><strong>Obesity in childhood impacts more than the body</strong></p><p>While the physical impact of obesity is well known, the mental impact can be just as serious.</p><p>&ldquo;Bullying is a huge issue,&rdquo; Dr. Joseph said. &ldquo;Many times, our patients say they don&rsquo;t eat lunch because they don&rsquo;t want to eat in front of people and they overeat when they go home. And if someone is worried about whether they&rsquo;re going to be physically or verbally abused, it&rsquo;s hard to concentrate in school.&rdquo;</p><p>For that reason, poor nutrition can affect grades and comprehension in class.</p><p>&ldquo;If they skip breakfast or eat a sugary breakfast like a Pop-Tart&reg;, the body will produce insulin and the blood sugar will drop. By 9 am, they&rsquo;re going to be irritable and unable to concentrate. If that&rsquo;s when they have math every day, it could have a negative impact over time on their performance.&rdquo;</p><p>But what could be causing obesity in children as young as 2 years old? At this age, many toddlers experience a dip in their weight as they reach their most active stage while also becoming pickier eaters.</p><p>&ldquo;In the last year, I&rsquo;ve been seeing significant, severe obesity in that age group &mdash; up to 150 pounds in a 5-year-old,&rdquo; Dr. Joseph said. &ldquo;We have accepted patients as young as age 2 to accommodate the needs we&rsquo;re seeing in the community. There is not currently great data on why, but it likely depends on maternal diet and health during pregnancy, and the food and activities they have access to.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Joseph and Dr. Mayo build personal connections with their patients to find out what motivates them to lose weight. It starts with the question, &ldquo;What does being healthy mean to you?&rdquo; They say that, for most children, it&rsquo;s not about avoiding diabetes or heart disease. They want to play on the football team, run as fast as their friends or wear their dream dress to prom.</p><p>&ldquo;We have to empower children and their families to make healthier choices,&rdquo; said Dr. Joseph.</p><p><strong>Top 5 takeaways to create a healthy lifestyle for your child</strong></p><p>1. &ldquo;Plan for breakfast. I know busy families don&rsquo;t have time in the morning, so prepare something ahead of time with lean protein like yogurt or eggs. Stay away from high-sugar and high-carb breakfasts,&rdquo; said Dr. Joseph.</p><p>2. &ldquo;Eat a colorful diet. Taking a photo and assessing it like artwork can help,&rdquo; said Dr. Joseph. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a boring photo and the plate is filled with only brown or beige foods, find ways to incorporate reds, greens, oranges and purples. Challenge your children to find colorful foods from the fridge to add to their plate. This is a different approach to add vegetables and fruits to their diet.&rdquo;</p><p>3. &ldquo;Minimize screen time as much as possible,&rdquo; Dr. Mayo said. &ldquo;Find ways to be active with your child, even if it&rsquo;s not outside. You can jump rope or dance inside too &mdash; just focus on moving.&rdquo;</p><p>4. &ldquo;Meal times as a family are important. It may not happen every day, but make it a point to eat together,&rdquo; said Dr. Joseph. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a time to share interesting things about your day and eat without distractions. If we eat while watching TV, we are not paying attention to how much we eat.&rdquo;</p><p>5. &ldquo;Fresh food is best, and the earlier exposure the better,&rdquo; said Dr. Mayo. &ldquo;Avoid processed foods, which are usually lower in nutritional value and higher in fat and calories. I also think many parents don&rsquo;t expose their children early enough to different foods. Doing so will help promote a varied palate and a healthy lifestyle.&rdquo;</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/child-health/you-are-your-childs-health-role-model\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Read more</em></a><em>&nbsp;examples of how to teach your child a healthy lifestyle.

Those who have understand how frightening it can be.</p><p>In the U.S., one in 10 adults experience panic attacks each year. About a third of people have at least one in their lifetime. Panic attacks usually come out of the blue and can happen even while you&rsquo;re sleeping.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a feeling of intense fear even though there is no present danger,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychiatrist/dr-yarelis-guzman-quinones-md\">Yarelis Guzman, MD,</a> a psychiatrist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\">Baptist Behavioral Health.</a></p><p>Common symptoms can include a racing heart, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, a choking feeling, nausea, numbness, tingling, or experiencing chills or profuse sweating. &ldquo;If you experience four or more of these symptoms at once, you are having a panic attack,&rdquo; explained Dr. Guzman.</p><p>&ldquo;Some people also experience &lsquo;derealization,&rsquo; which is when you feel detached from your surroundings, like being in a dream,&rdquo; explained Dr. Guzman.</p><p>Often, panic attacks occur in tandem with other mental health conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression. &ldquo;Physical conditions like asthma can also cause panic attacks due to the fear of suddenly not being able to breathe,&rdquo; said Dr. Guzman. In addition, smokers and people with a family history of allergies are more at risk.</p><p>To ward off or minimize a panic attack, Dr. Guzman offers these tips:</p><ul><li>Take deep, slow breaths &ndash; four seconds in and seven seconds out.</li><li>Recognize that you are having a panic attack and that it is temporary.</li><li>Get grounded using the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise: Acknowledge 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste.</li><li>Relax your muscles.

It was very overwhelming.&rdquo;</p><p>The 42-year-old mother of two readily admits that her fear of MRI machines isn&rsquo;t rational. She&rsquo;s not alone in feeling that way.

She learned that just because a facility calls itself an open MRI, it may not be. True open MRI machines have two flat magnets with a large space between where the patient lies. This configuration keeps the space open on four sides and alleviates much of the claustrophobia many patients experience with traditional, tunnel-shaped machines. Open MRIs can also accommodate larger patients weighing up to 650 pounds. A high-field, true open MRI, like the one at Premier, also offers less time in the scanner due to faster scanning capabilities.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very different experience because you don&rsquo;t feel like you are completely closed in,&rdquo; said Robertson, who typically has both a brain and cervical scan in the same visit. &ldquo;The last time I was at Premier, I brought my mom along and they allowed her to accompany me into the scan room and sit in a chair next to the machine. She kept patting me on the legs to let me know she was there.&rdquo;</p><p>After successfully completing the MRI at Premier, Robertson&rsquo;s internist, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/internist/dr-rajesh-gopal-md\" target=\"_blank\">Rajesh Gopal, MD</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a>, was able to make an accurate diagnosis based on the results of the scan, which provided high quality images of Robertson&rsquo;s brain and spine to show what was causing her symptoms.</p><p>&ldquo;One of the things I really appreciate about Premier is they don&rsquo;t treat your fears lightly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They even took me out of the head coil a couple of times when there was a break between scans.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Scheduling early helps</strong></p><p>Robertson said she takes medication prescribed by her neurologist, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurologist/dr-thomas-snyder-md\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Snyder, MD</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-neurology\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Neurology</a>, the day of the exam and the night before to help calm her nerves.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>In June, Leigh Ann Rassler celebrated the one-year anniversary of her life-changing sinus surgery with a visitors post on <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health&rsquo;s&nbsp;</a>Facebook page.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/otolaryngologist-ent/dr-scott-scharer-md\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Scharer, MD</a>, and your team at Baptist ENT Specialists for drastically improving my quality of life,&rdquo; her post read.</p><p>The days of waking up every morning with dark circles under her eyes, constant facial pain, and sinus pressure are a distant memory for Rassler.</p><p>Her medicine cabinet has a lot more shelf room, too.</p><p>&ldquo;The only time I take something now is when my eyes are itching; it&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m sneezing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And if I do take an antihistamine, I break it in half.&rdquo;</p><p>A busy public relations executive, Rassler never thought there was anything that could be surgically done to relieve the chronic sinus problems that had plagued her since the early 1990s.&nbsp;</p><p>Then her Baptist Primary Care physician, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-jackson-downey-md\" target=\"_blank\">H. Jackson Downey, MD</a>, referred her to Dr. Scharer, a board-certified otolaryngologist, or ear, nose and throat specialist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-ent-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist ENT Specialists</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;It just so happened that the day I saw Dr. Scharer, I had a full-blown sinus infection,&rdquo; recalled Rassler. &ldquo;He sent me to have a CT scan and when I went back to see him, I knew he wasn&rsquo;t just going to prescribe meds because when he walked into the exam room he was holding a laptop.&rdquo;</p><p>On the laptop were images of Rassler&rsquo;s CT scan, which showed that five of her eight sinuses were blocked. She also had a deviated septum, where one nasal passage is smaller than the other, and a swollen turbinate, a boney structure on the side of the inner nose that helps regulate airflow.</p><p>Dr. Scharer performed a procedure to straighten Rassler&rsquo;s deviated septum, followed by endoscopic sinus surgery to enlarge her nasal drainage pathways and improve her sinus ventilation.</p><p>Rassler&rsquo;s surgery took about 90 minutes. She was out of work for a few weeks, but hasn&rsquo;t taken a sick day since. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been over a year and I haven&rsquo;t had any sinus issues,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My face doesn&rsquo;t hurt and my ears are not closed up anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Dr. Scharer, it&rsquo;s important to stress that there is no surgical cure for environmental allergies. However, there are people who have severe underlying anatomical constraints that make it much more difficult for them to breathe comfortably, or make it much more likely for the mucus to get trapped if they get a cold or allergy flare-up.</p><p>&ldquo;Those are the patients that can really benefit from sinonasal procedures,&rdquo; added Dr. Scharer. &nbsp;</p><p>In her spare time, Rassler creates and executes film promotions, serves as a local film critic and enjoys attending movie conventions.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my passion, but I always had to worry if a different climate would set off another sinus infection,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&quot;I&rsquo;ve been on several trips since the surgery and I haven&rsquo;t gotten sick. Before, my body was always fighting these infections. I can even breathe through my nose now when I run on the treadmill, and lift weights and do exercises that I used to avoid due to sinus pain and pressure.&rdquo;</p><p><br></p><p><em>If you are a sinus sufferer and need an ENT, visit <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-ent-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist ENT Specialists</a>.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>When it comes to babies and toys, most of us don&rsquo;t put a lot of thought into what we offer our little ones other than whether they&rsquo;re a fun distraction and safe. But toys can be much more than diversionary items that you find yourself cleaning up off the floor every day. Children under a year old are going through a period of rapid physical and cognitive growth, so giving them age-appropriate toys promotes the development of motor skills, vision and eye/hand coordination that build the foundation for higher level tasks down the road such as feeding, dressing and writing.</p><p>&ldquo;The value of providing toys to babies is so much greater than giving them something for entertainment,&rdquo; said Karen Reckamp, OTR/L, ATP, a pediatric occupational therapist and clinical educator for <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/rehabilitation\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Rehabilitation</a>. &ldquo;The right toy not only promotes fine motor development and motor control, but it can help a baby organize his or her ability to process sight, sound, taste, touch and smell, and how these senses relate to the world around them.&rdquo;</p><p>For newborns to those about a year old, lightweight, easy-to grasp toys that make sounds or are visually appealing with lights or bright colors are best. In addition, toys that teach cause and effect, such as music playing or something popping up when a button is pushed, help to develop social, cognitive and communication skills.</p><p>Just as important as choosing the right toys is making sure you don&rsquo;t introduce too many at the same time. The goal isn&rsquo;t to overstimulate baby but to focus on one thing at a time.</p><p>&ldquo;If you offer too many toys, it can be overwhelming and it takes away from baby&rsquo;s ability to focus and explore an item,&rdquo; said Reckamp.</p><p>Top skills that toys can help sharpen by 12 months are:</p><ul><li>Reaching across the body (crossing the midline) &ndash; promotes motor and cognitive skills by training the right and left sides of the brain to effectively communicate</li><li>Transference of toys between hands &ndash; develops eye/hand coordination and midline orientation</li><li>Object permanence &ndash; teaches the child that a dropped toy is only out of sight, not lost; also important for learning to separate from a caregiver by understanding that when she leaves the room, she is not gone forever</li><li>Visual tracking (following objects with the eyes) &ndash; develops necessary visual skills for accurate reach and grasp</li><li>Tactile input &ndash; touching various textures provides sensory feedback for valuable learning about the shape, size, and texture of objects</li></ul>",

I started shaking and trembling. I was in shock, especially since you only hear about women getting it.&rdquo;</p><p>An avid golfer with two holes-in-one at his Fernandina Beach golf club, Eason assumed the quarter-sized nodule he found on his chest was from playing so much of his favorite sport.</p><p>&ldquo;My chest was sore and I could feel a little knot,&rdquo; said Eason, a Fernandina Beach resident. &ldquo;It was starting to affect my swing.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/general-surgeon/dr-t-stevens-felger-md\">Steve Felger, MD,</a> a general surgeon at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center/breast-cancer\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center,&nbsp;</a>assured Eason that the knot was most likely benign, but performed a biopsy just to be certain.</p><p>The surprising results led Eason to have surgery to remove his left breast, followed by chemotherapy and radiation because the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes. &ldquo;It was hard to lose a breast. I can&rsquo;t imagine how hard this is for a woman,&rdquo; added Eason, a career police officer who recently retired after more than 20 years.</p><p>Less than one percent of all breast cancer cases develop in men, and only one in a thousand men will ever be diagnosed with breast cancer, according to the National Breast Cancer Foundation. Families with a strong history of breast cancer often carry gene mutations.</p><p>Although nobody in his family has had breast cancer, Eason had the BRCA1 genetic test, which showed he does have the gene that causes cells to mutate and leads to cancer. He urged his children, both police officers, to have the test. His son Allen doesn&rsquo;t have the gene; however, his daughter Jaime does.</p><p>Since the genetic test results came in, Jaime has had a double mastectomy to lessen her chances of developing breast cancer in the future.</p><p>In May 2016, nine years after his breast cancer diagnosis, Eason started having trouble breathing. He was shocked to learn the breast cancer had metastasized to his lung and lymph nodes. His hematologist/oncologist put him on oral chemotherapy immediately.</p><p>Although the aggressive regimen left him feeling drained and nauseous, Eason finally got the news he was praying for: A recent PET scan showed he is cancer-free once again.</p><p>&ldquo;I was so relieved, I actually hugged the doctor,&rdquo; said Eason, who is back on the golf course and competing in tournaments again.&nbsp;</p>",

Then the rough skin of the shark&rsquo;s brow.</p><p>He knew immediately that his fun day surfing with his 8-year-old son had taken a dangerous turn.</p><p>Theobald didn&rsquo;t see much of the shark, just the tail. &ldquo;I guess he didn&rsquo;t like what he tasted because he let go,&rdquo; he chuckled &ldquo;Then, he went one way and I went the other!&rdquo;</p><p>The Fernandina Beach resident hobbled to shore &mdash; the open wound on his foot a four-inch serrated gash from the shark&rsquo;s bite. It wasn&rsquo;t a terrible wound, thankfully, but what made it unusual was that, within just a matter of minutes, another individual was bitten by a shark just down the beach.</p><p>Before that afternoon, only four shark attacks had been recorded in Nassau County in the last 135 years &mdash; despite Florida being the shark attack capital of the world. While a majority of attacks occur on the Sunshine State&rsquo;s southern shores, Duval County ranks fifth in the state for the total number of shark bites.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been bitten, and I don&rsquo;t know anyone who has or anybody who knows anybody who has been bitten,&rdquo; said Theobald, who was treated at both Baptist Medical Center Nassau and Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be scared doing something you love. We know they are out there, but you just don&rsquo;t think about it.&rdquo;</p><p>But, there are easy tips you can follow to help a shark bite victim and avoid becoming one yourself.</p><p>Most shark bites tend to be hit-and-run, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/emergency-medical-specialist/dr-jeffrey-smowton-md\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffrey Smowton, MD</a>, chief of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-beaches\" target=\"_blank\">Emergency Medicine</a> at Baptist Medical Center Beaches. Though it depends on the size of the wound and its location, the majority of bites can be addressed with direct pressure on the wound, he added.</p><p>Using clothing, towels or whatever you want to stem the blood flow helps the victim until emergency personnel arrives.</p><p>In extreme cases, the wound could require a tourniquet. However, Dr. Smowton says he&rsquo;s been doing emergency medicine for years and has never seen a case that required one.</p><p>Call 911 immediately after getting the individual out of the water.</p><p>&ldquo;Remember how rare this is,&rdquo; Dr. Smowton said. &ldquo;Everybody is scared in the moments after an attack &ndash; and I would be, too. But, 32 people a year die of lightning strikes. With shark bites, a person dies every other year.&rdquo;</p><p>Unfortunately, there really isn&rsquo;t a way to tell if a shark is present.</p><p>However, Jim Gelsleichter, PhD, University of North Florida Shark Biology Program director, recommends people exercise caution when swimming at dawn, dusk and nighttime when sharks are most active.</p><p>Even so, more people are bitten during the day because there are more people at the beach during daytime hours. Shiny objects like jewelry or even tattoos could attract a shark to an individual.</p><p>&ldquo;There is strong evidence the odds for shark-related injuries are likely more related to human activity rather than increases in coastal shark activity,&rdquo; Dr. Gelsleichter said. &ldquo;Many scientists believe most shark bites occur as a result of mistaken identity &mdash; that the animals bite with the expectation they are feeding on prey.&rdquo;</p><p>If you happen to be on the wrong side of a shark tasting, Dr. Gelsleichter has two words of advice: &ldquo;FIGHT BACK!&rdquo;</p><p>He suggests targeting the shark&rsquo;s sensitive areas, such as the eyes, gills or snout. It is likely the shark will let go &mdash; a common occurrence in bites that happen off the Florida coast.</p><p>Most Florida bites are nonfatal, tending to be caused by smaller species such as the blacktip or spinner shark. &ldquo;Sharks are there all the time,&rdquo; Dr. Smowton said. &nbsp;&ldquo;The bottom line is it is very unusual to be bitten by a shark. Most are accidental &mdash; a bump and bite. The shark tastes, and then he leaves. So, we don&rsquo;t want to scare people out of getting into the water.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Does morning sickness mean you are having a girl? Do your feet grow when you&rsquo;re pregnant? Does your sense of smell get better? As an OB/GYN, I get lots of questions from my patients about pregnancy myths. Here are some common myths dispelled:</p><p><strong>How you carry determines the sex of the baby.</strong><br><em>Answer: Fiction</em><br>Some patients think carrying high means you&#39;re having a girl and carrying low means it&rsquo;s a boy. I have also heard it the other way around. The truth is there is no correlation between how you carry and whether pink or blue is in your future. Your OB can usually determine the sex of your baby between 16 and 20 weeks with an ultrasound.</p><p><strong>If you have heartburn during pregnancy, your baby will be born with lots of hair.</strong><br><em>Answer: Fact</em><br>It may be surprising, but a recent Johns Hopkins study actually did find a correlation between heartburn and a full head of hair. This is likely because heartburn during pregnancy is due to estrogen that causes the esophagus to relax. It&rsquo;s thought that the higher levels of estrogen cause the baby to be born with more hair than usual. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Farewell to feta?</strong><br><em>Answer: Fiction</em><br>The rumor is that you can&rsquo;t eat soft cheeses, which isn&rsquo;t the case. You need to steer clear of unpasteurized cheeses or any type of <em>unpasteurized</em> dairy products because they may carry disease-causing organisms. Almost all cheese sold in the U.S. &ndash; including soft cheese &ndash; is made with pasteurized milk and is considered safe to eat.</p><p><strong>It&rsquo;s OK to eat for two.</strong><br><em>Answer: Fiction</em><br>The <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-pregnant-women-weight-gain-20151105-story.html\">Centers for Disease Control</a> says that nearly half of all American women gain more weight than they should during pregnancy. A normal-weight woman should gain between 25 and 30 pounds. If you eat a well-balanced diet, your baby will get the nutrients needed. I recommend taking a daily pre-natal vitamin as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Coloring your hair is a no-go.</strong><br><em>Answer: Fiction</em><br>Good news. You don&rsquo;t need to deal with roots nor gray hair during pregnancy. Your body absorbs very little hair dye, so there is not a risk associated with keeping up with the color.</p><p><strong>Steer clear of the cat litter box.</strong><br><em>Answer: Fact</em><br>Apologies to your partner, but it&rsquo;s true. Cat feces can expose you to toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease. While not dangerous for most people, the condition can be passed along to the unborn child, which can cause birth defects and sometimes death.</p><p><strong>A cup of Joe is a cup of no.</strong><br><em>Answer: Fiction</em><br>You can have up to 200 milligrams of caffeine a day. A typical cup of brewed coffee has about 95 milligrams. Be sure to account for other caffeine culprits, such as chocolate, soda and tea.</p><p><strong>An occasional glass of wine or beer is OK.</strong><br><em>Answer: Fiction</em><br>Because there is no way to know how much alcohol is safe during pregnancy, most OB/GYNs, including me, recommend avoiding it completely. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, and a range of disabilities.</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t get vaccines when pregnant.</strong><br><em>Answer: Fiction</em><br>Two vaccines you need during pregnancy are the flu shot and a tetanus booster. When you&rsquo;re pregnant, there&rsquo;s a higher risk of getting the flu, and it can be more serious. &nbsp;A tetanus booster is important because it protects the baby from whooping cough. Both shots are safe during any stage of pregnancy.</p><p><strong>Pregnancy can cause your feet to grow.</strong><br><em>Answer: Fact</em><br>Water weight and extra fluid can cause your feet to swell by up to one size larger and can remain that way post-pregnancy.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>After a weekend celebrating her husband&rsquo;s 40th birthday, Kelly Lands, dizzy and sweaty, thought the stress of party planning must have caught up to her. An hour later, she decided the symptoms weren&rsquo;t going away &mdash; and maybe, just maybe, she was experiencing something more than post-celebration jitters.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I was having a heart attack,&rdquo; said Lands, director of operations at a local hotel. &ldquo;My heart was racing at more than 200 beats per minute. I was at home, lying in bed, and I thought if I just relaxed it would go away, but it never did.&rdquo;</p><p>The symptoms turned out to be atrial fibrillation (Afib), an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase risk of stroke and other heart-related complications.</p><p>&ldquo;Being diagnosed with atrial fibrillation [Afib for short] isn&rsquo;t unusual, but for Kelly, it definitely isn&rsquo;t normal,&rdquo; said Aaditya Vora, MD, cardiac electrophysiologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a>. &ldquo;Her age places her on the lower end of the spectrum for women with atrial fibrillation. Women experiencing symptoms like Kelly&rsquo;s are often told there is nothing wrong when they are actually having Afib.&rdquo;</p><p>When Lands arrived at the emergency room, Baptist Health team members immediately used an EKG machine to see what was wrong. Noting her racing heartbeat, she received medicine to slow its pace and then stayed overnight to ensure she was OK. Nothing happened. No irregular heartbeat. No racing pulse. No sweaty palms.</p><p>The next morning, she left thinking maybe it had been a one-time concern. Two weeks later, Lands returned to Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville with similar symptoms. The doctors determined it was Afib. &ldquo;Looking back on my first episode, I hadn&rsquo;t had any alcohol or caffeine,&rdquo; Lands said. &ldquo;In my situation, I knew those couldn&rsquo;t be a trigger. There had to be something really wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>After her diagnosis, Lands elected to have surgery to try to correct the symptoms. According to Dr. Vora, atrial fibrillation ablation involves entering the veins in the leg and navigating to the heart. There, he uses either radiofrequency energy or a freeze balloon (cryoballoon) to create a disruption in the faulty electrical impulses causing the arrhythmia (a heart rhythm disturbance).</p><p>In a normal heart, the heart&#39;s pacemaker sets the tone &mdash; but in patients with atrial fibrillation, the pacemaker is no longer working properly and instead the heartbeat is chaotic and irregular. The minimally invasive procedure aims to correct the symptoms and is especially useful for patients who respond poorly to medication. Treatment usually improves the arrhythmia and associated issues, such as fatigue and shortness of breath.</p><p><strong>Determined to avoid lifetime of meds</strong></p><p>Diagnosed at 46, Lands didn&rsquo;t want to spend the rest of her life taking medication in an attempt to manage those symptoms. Surgery made sense to her, even though using ablation to treat Afib isn&rsquo;t always a 100-percent fix.</p><p>&ldquo;Because Kelly is younger and the medication failed to work, we talked about different options, including this procedure,&rdquo; Dr. Vora said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s twice as effective as medication, and it doesn&rsquo;t have all the side effects. We just have to work with her long-term and manage her risk factors to make sure the atrial fibrillation doesn&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo;</p><p>For Lands, the procedure was a simple overnight experience. Now, by managing her blood pressure, she&rsquo;s able to nearly eliminate the potential that it returns.</p><p>Atrial fibrillation can often be caused by risk factors such as heart disease, valve disease, thyroid issues, obesity and age. It can increase the risk of stroke, but correcting Afib doesn&rsquo;t prevent stroke, Dr. Vora said.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>It&rsquo;s one of the saddest tragedies, but we have seen it increase over the past twenty years &mdash; an average of 37 children annually die after suffering heatstroke in a vehicle from which they cannot escape. Since 1998, 772 children have died in the U.S. from vehicular heatstroke. Overall, Florida is second only to Texas in the number of deaths during this time frame. There have been two deaths in our state this year, and one in nearby Kingsland, Georgia, in June.</p><p>Victims tend to be among the youngest and most vulnerable, with babies less than one year old and one- to two-year-olds representing over half of the deaths. Statistics reveal that two- through six-year-old children are still at high risk and, surprisingly, children all the way to age 14 have been victims of vehicular heatstroke.</p><p>As parents, grandparents and caregivers, it is our duty to the children in our care to understand the risk factors that contribute to the problem, take those risks seriously and always use best practices to prevent harm.</p><p><strong>Risk factors</strong></p><p>First, children&rsquo;s bodies heat up three to five times faster than adults because their temperature regulation is not as efficient, putting them at greater risk for heat-related illnesses, including heatstroke.</p><p>Second, although many deaths in hot cars do occur during the hottest months of the year, it doesn&rsquo;t require a hot day to heat up the inside of a vehicle to dangerous temperatures. This misunderstanding can be fatal &mdash; deaths have occurred in temperatures as low as 72 degrees.</p><p>Hot car deaths are not due to the outside air temperature, but the sun heating up the interior of the car, increasing the temperature inside very quickly. Within 20 minutes, the inside of the vehicle heats up an average of 29 degrees and cracking a window was shown to have very little effect.</p><p>When a core body temperature of 107 degrees Fahrenheit or greater is reached, cells are damaged and internal organs begin to shut down. This chain of events can rapidly lead to death.</p><p><strong>Safety measures</strong></p><p>The experts at Safe Kids Worldwide, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NoHeatStroke.org and KidsandCars.org are working hard to educate the public about prevention of pediatric vehicular heatstroke. They urge all parents, caregivers and those that transport children to remember the following:</p><ul><li>Never leave a child unattended in a vehicle, even for a minute! <strong>Eighteen percent of hot car deaths occur because children were left alone in a hot car intentionally.</strong></li><li>Always lock your car and ensure children do not have access to keys or remote entry devices. Teach children that vehicles are never to be used as a play area. <strong>Twenty-seven percent of children killed in hot cars were playing alone in a vehicle or gained access themselves.</strong></li><li>Have a plan with your childcare provider to call you if your child does not show up for school. <strong>Fifty-four percent of children involved in vehicular heatstroke were left in the car unintentionally.</strong> This happens most often when routines change. For example, the parent who normally drops off at daycare before to work is preoccupied with going to the airport for travel instead, forgetting the daycare stop altogether. A call from your child&rsquo;s caregiver could save a life when a change in routine occurs.</li><li>Keep a stuffed animal in the car seat. When the child is put in the seat, place the animal in the front with the driver. Or place your purse, briefcase or cell phone in the back seat with your child. These make great reminders that you have your child in the car.</li><li>Make &quot;look before you leave&quot; a routine whenever you get out of the car and always glance in the backseat for any young passengers.</li><li>Be sure that all occupants leave the vehicle when unloading. Don&#39;t overlook sleeping babies.</li><li>If a child is missing, always check the pool first and then the car, including the trunk.</li><li>If you see a child unattended in a hot vehicle, call 911 immediately.</li></ul><p>Hot car tragedies are preventable, but it will take all of us working together to spread the word so each parent and caregiver can make a difference for the children in their care.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>The importance of getting your children and sometimes yourselves vaccinated to protect your children from vaccine preventable diseases cannot be overemphasized. Each person who is immunized in a community increases what is called a &#39;herd immunity,&#39; preventing the spread of a disease by having fewer susceptible individuals therby breaking the chain of the infection cycle, and providing a level of protection to those who cannot get vaccinated due to a low immune system, age or pregnancy. I would like to address some questions I am often asked.</p><p><strong>Are vaccines safe?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Yes, they are safe. They&rsquo;ve been studied for their safety as well as their ability to prevent diseases that have the potential of making children very ill &ndash; possibly causing death in some cases.</p><p><strong>Why vaccinate?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Because of vaccination, many diseases fortunately no longer exist in the general population. Smallpox has been eradicated as a direct result of vaccinating, and polio has been eliminated from 99 percent of the world. Other diseases such as mumps and chicken pox have been decreased significantly and we see fewer cases but we have to keep immunizing because if we don&rsquo;t, we lose that important level of immunity, and the disease can come back &ndash; as we&rsquo;ve recently seen with measles.</p><p><strong>Why do parents still choose not to get their children immunized?</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s some misinformation that has caused people to make false assumptions. A 1998 falsified study published in a British medical journal The Lancet suggested a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and autism, a study that has since been discredited and proven to be scientifically untrue. Many other studies since have also validated the safety of MMR.</p><p>Over the years, there also have been incorrect parallels drawn between reactions to certain vaccines that happened to coincide with unrelated conditions that children already had. The pertussis vaccine was incorrectly associated with causing seizures and neurological problems in some children but it was later confirmed that those children had a form of epilepsy that begins in infancy.</p><p><strong>Which areas of the country fall short in following through with immunization?</strong></p><p>Throughout the country, the rates are not as good as we&rsquo;d like to see them. States have different immunization laws, which can lead to such trends.</p><p><strong>Is it ok to space out vaccines?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Spacing out and delaying vaccinations is very dangerous. Parents worry that they might be overloading their babies&rsquo; immune systems but that&rsquo;s not true. It&rsquo;s important to go by the standard vaccine schedule approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They&rsquo;ve looked at which vaccines are appropriate and safe to give and at what ages because those are the ages when infection is most likely to occur. Any delay puts the child at increased risk. There are no alternative schedules; theirs is the standard schedule, and all others are &ldquo;dangerous schedules.&rdquo; For information on what the recommended vaccination timetable is, you can go to the AAP&rsquo;s immunization webpage.</p><p><strong>Q: Where can you go to find free or low-cost vaccines?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A: Children who are on Medicaid are covered for recommended vaccines, and most insurance companies cover necessary immunizations. For those who do not have insurance, the local health department offers them through the Florida Vaccines for Children program.</p><p><em>Our guest columnist is <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-infectious-disease-specialist/dr-mobeen-rathore-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mobeen Rathore, MD</a></em><em>, chief of Infectious Diseases and Immunology at&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.com\"><em>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital&nbsp;</em></a><em>and vice-chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics, District X.</em></p><p><strong>Other resources:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/immunizations/Pages/Immunizations-home.aspx?\" target=\"_blank\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/child.html\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control&#39;s Recommended Immunization Schedule (Birth through 6 years of age)</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/preteen-teen.html\" target=\"_blank\">CDC&#39;s Recommended Immunization Schedule (Ages 7 through 18 years)</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-services/immunization/vaccines-for-children/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Florida Vaccines for Children Program</a></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>A dinner out with a friend. A road trip to Orlando. An uninterrupted night&rsquo;s sleep and living pain-free. This is Lisa Mitchell&rsquo;s new normal.</p><p>For more than two years, the 46-year-old suffered from severe pain in her pelvis and back because of a nonfunctioning bladder. Sometimes she would go to the bathroom 60 times in 24 hours and up to 32 times a night. At work, she would get up from her desk&mdash;at times every 15 minutes&mdash;to use the bathroom. Traveling for her sales job became impossible.</p><p>Mitchell often lived with catheters to help empty her bladder and would wear loose clothes or long dresses to hide the bag attached to her leg. Biopsies of her bladder turned up no cancer. Medications and therapies didn&rsquo;t help. She was hospitalized when her kidneys started to fail. Mitchell&rsquo;s doctors were running out of options.</p><p>She was ultimately diagnosed with follicular cystitis, or FC, a rare and non-specific inflammatory disease of the bladder, and inflammatory pseudotumor of the bladder, which is a rare, benign condition of multiple lesions.</p><p>&ldquo;The pain was overwhelming in my pelvis and sometimes it would shoot through my back,&rdquo; said Mitchell, who lives in Mandarin. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have control of your life. You can&rsquo;t sit through a movie or go to the mall. You can&rsquo;t do anything. It controls you.&rdquo;</p><p>She found a solution in January after her urologist connected her with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/urologist/dr-seth-strope-md\" target=\"_blank\">Seth Strope, MD</a>, urologic oncologist surgeon and head of urologic oncology at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>, after trying some additional treatments with no success, Mitchell opted to have her bladder removed and a new one made out of a portion of her small intestines.</p><p>&ldquo;Inflammatory pseudotumor looks like sarcoma, but it&rsquo;s not malignant. It&rsquo;s also not normal and she wasn&rsquo;t recovering,&rdquo; said Dr. Strope, who performed the surgery at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville. &ldquo;We tried to treat conservatively to see if we could preserve her renal function. But despite efforts to relax her bladder and help her bladder function, it was progressively getting worse so she chose to undergo surgery.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Strope, assisted by Mitchell&rsquo;s urologist <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/urologist/dr-charles-cobb-md\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Cobb, MD</a>, removed her bladder, using robotic-assisted surgery and making small incisions that spared her reproductive organs. From about a foot of her small intestine, Dr. Strope constructed a pouch and placed it back in the same position as her original bladder.</p><p>The new bladder, called a &ldquo;neobladder&rdquo; was attached to her ureters, the tubes that carry urine produced by the kidneys.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s doing very well,&rdquo; Dr. Strope said. &ldquo;Now she can sleep through the night. Her quality of life is better.&rdquo;</p><p>All the pain and inconvenience she endured was worth it in the end, Mitchell said.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted something as natural as possible and to be able to leave my other organs in place. I was all for it. I just wanted something to help me,&rdquo; Mitchell said.</p><p>She is grateful to Dr. Strope and Dr. Cobb.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big miracle,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even begin to tell you how happy I am. I can do things I have not been able to do for a long time. I only get up once or twice a night. It&rsquo;s the difference between night and day.&rdquo;</p><p>Mitchell said she&rsquo;s back to working out at the gym for the first time in three years. She is out enjoying friends and going on long rides to Orlando and Savannah.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy to go out and enjoy myself,&rdquo; Mitchell said. &ldquo;Just like that, I feel normal again.&rdquo;</p><p>While not every bladder problem is as extreme as Lisa&rsquo;s, frequent urination, pelvic pain and incontinence are very common issues among women of all ages. That&rsquo;s why, in addition to offering advanced surgical options, Baptist Health also offers unique wellness resources for women through its 4her Center for Women &ndash; including the T<a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/4her-center-for-women\" target=\"_blank\">otal Control&copy; pelvic health and wellness program</a>.

Several other studies have documented areas of brain atrophy associated with hearing loss.</p><p>Over the years, my conversations with patients regarding hearing loss have centered around the quality of life issues associated with hearing aids.

Studies have demonstrated the tendency for isolation and even depression.</p><p>Recently, there has been mounting evidence that hearing loss is associated with brain health. In 2011, Dr. Frank Lin at Johns Hopkins reported on a 10-year study where individuals with mild, moderate and severe hearing loss had a two-, three- and five-fold increased risk of dementia respectively. The follow-up study in 2013 revealed a 30-40 percent rate of accelerated cognitive decline in older adults with hearing loss.</p><p>Reinforcing these findings, several studies have documented areas of brain atrophy associated with hearing loss.

These three activities may reduce your risk of dementia by keeping your brain and your heart happy and healthy.</p><p>&ldquo;By living a brain-healthy lifestyle, you may be able to reduce your risk of dementia,&rdquo; said Lynda Gridley, a speech-language pathologist who provides cognitive therapy at the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/geriatric-care\">Baptist AgeWell Center for Senior Health.</a></p><p>There are some risk factors for dementia you can&rsquo;t change. According to the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society, people over the age of 65 have a higher risk than younger individuals. Other risk factors include family history and ethnicity.</p><p>Here are some tips from the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society that may help reduce your risk:</p><p><strong>Exercise.</strong> What&rsquo;s good for your heart is good for your brain. Being active, even if it&rsquo;s a brisk walk on a regular basis, can lower your blood pressure and improve your cholesterol.</p><p><strong>Eat healthy.</strong> Maintain a <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/features/mind-diet-alzheimers-disease#1\">&ldquo;MIND diet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</a>It&rsquo;s a fusion of the Mediterranean and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets, emphasizing vegetables, fruits, nuts, fish, olive oil and a glass of red wine a day. You can find a variety of recipes and tips online.</p><p><strong>Be social.</strong> Interacting with others by organizing or attending social activities or meetings is good for your brain and your heart. For instance, try to have set meeting times with friends every week or join a community group.</p><p><strong>Challenge yourself.</strong> Go to the library, learn a new language, go on adventures and cross items off your &ldquo;bucket list.&rdquo; Learning and seeing new things can improve memory, attention span, and reasoning skills.</p><p><strong>Have a sense of purpose</strong>.

The disease may start with subtle signs of memory loss and progress to not recognizing family and friends.</p><p>While we all have memory loss on occasion, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we are bound to have dementia or Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease any time soon, or at all, for that matter. So, what&#39;s the difference between normal memory loss and dementia?</p><p>Dementia is an umbrella term for a group of progressive neurological diseases that cause deterioration of cognitive ability. According to the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association, there are 200 types of dementia, with Alzheimer&rsquo;s accounting for up to 80 percent of all cases.</p><p>&ldquo;Memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia,&rdquo; said Lynda Gridley, a speech-language pathologist at the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/agewell-center-for-senior-health\">Baptist AgeWell Center for Senior Health.</a> &ldquo;The brain sorts out the most significant memories, so it&rsquo;s typical for the average person to forget a short-term memory, like what they ate for breakfast last Tuesday, but be able to remember graduating from college.</p><p>For dementia patients, immediate and short-term memories are hard to retain, while long-term memories tend to remain. For instance, they may remember their wedding day, but forget what they ate hours before.</p><p>Here are some common signs of dementia:</p><ul><li>Impaired immediate/short-term memory. People with dementia might have trouble learning new things, especially when placed in a new environment and out of their comfort zone. Simple tasks, like cooking or cleaning, may seem overwhelming.</li><li>Difficulties with time. They may begin to miss appointments or take their morning medication twice in one day because they can&rsquo;t keep track of time.</li><li>Word finding. The words they are looking for get lost in translation. They might be able to describe it, but cannot find the right words or forget what they are trying to say mid-sentence.</li><li>Decreased recognition of the difficulties they are having. They may have a lack of insight or deny recent difficulties.</li><li>Getting lost in familiar places. They may get lost in their local park or grocery store they&rsquo;ve been going to for many years.</li></ul><p>If you notice these signs in your loved one, Gridley suggests seeing a neurologist or a geriatrician and to follow these tips for maintaining the peace.</p><p>&ldquo;Watching someone you care about experience a progressive decline in mental ability can be tough on everyone involved,&rdquo; said Gridley. &ldquo;The sooner a person is diagnosed, the better, because treatment and therapy are most effective when started early in the disease process.&rdquo;</p><p><em>To learn more about assessing your memory health and determining your risk factors for dementia, call Baptist AgeWell at 904.202.4AGE (4243).</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Expecting your first baby is very exciting, but it can also be overwhelming. So much to decide, so many choices and a pretty firm deadline to boot.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve assembled a handy checklist to help you navigate the choices before, during and after your most blessed event. Most of all: Relax! Don&rsquo;t let all the preparation overshadow the joy and anticipation you feel.</p><ol><li><strong>Start with you.</strong> If you just found out you&rsquo;re pregnant, take care of your body first. Eat healthy, get proper exercise and cut out caffeine and alcohol.</li><li><strong>Create a birth plan.</strong> Your birth plan will help you choose your obstetrician, which will determine where you&rsquo;ll deliver your baby. You&rsquo;ll also decide whether to try a natural birth or choose an epidural and pain medication. Pick who will be in the room with you before the big day to avoid an awkward situation. There are lots of choices for moms these days, so read up on what makes the most sense for you, your beliefs and your pain threshold. You also may want to read about cesarean deliveries, since sometimes that is an option.</li><li><strong>Sign up for classes.&nbsp;</strong>There are <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/patient-info/classes-and-events\">many classes available</a> to help you through your pregnancy. Baptist Health offers several at its four main hospital campuses, including an 8-hour Prepared Childbirth course, recommended during the second trimester, which covers what to expect during the birthing process, pain management, cesarean birth and postpartum care. Sign up early, though &ndash; these classes tend to fill up quickly. &quot;I believe the most important reason to take a childbirth preparation class is that education and preparation are power,&rdquo; said Amy Bradfield, RNC, BSN, a certified childbirth educator at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-south\">Baptist Medical Center South.</a> &ldquo;It helps reduce fears of the unknown, and empowers you to make good decisions. It&rsquo;s also a great way to meet new people who are going through the same thing you are.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Pick your team.</strong> The most important person on your team once your baby is born is the pediatrician or family physician, and the first checkup comes just one to days after discharge. Find one you like and trust, and line up your appointments ahead of time. Most offer a prenatal appointment so parents can get information about vaccinations, circumcision, umbilical cord blood banking, and provide after-hours contact numbers.</li><li><strong>Navigate the hospital paperwork.&nbsp;</strong>Most hospitals offer maternity suite tours and pre-registration. Pre-registration allows you to get your name, insurance information and obstetrician&rsquo;s contact information in the hospital&rsquo;s system so it&rsquo;s already there when you arrive, reducing the amount of paperwork you&rsquo;ll need to fill out. Plan to bring your photo ID and insurance card with you.</li><li><strong>Get packed.</strong> Pack your bag early, too. Put some thought into what necessities you&rsquo;d like to have to help keep you comfortable, such as lip balm, snacks, eyeglasses, a comfy bathrobe, nursing bra and a going-home outfit for your baby. Many Labor and Delivery (L&amp;D) Centers feature environments that are more like being at home, with the addition of some special amenities. <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-beaches\">Baptist Medical Center Beaches</a> recently renovated its L&amp;D with spa-like suites for moms to bond with their newborns. The center offers comfy sleeper sofas and recliners, large private bathrooms, and select spa treatments, like massages.</li><li><strong>Secure the ride home.&nbsp;</strong>Taking your newborn home can be a little scary as you leave the protective environment of the hospital, but you&rsquo;ll feel better if you&rsquo;re comfortable with how the car seat works, and how to install it.</li></ol><p>&ldquo;Following passenger safety car seat guidelines is not only an important factor in keeping your baby safe while you&rsquo;re traveling in the car, but it&rsquo;s Florida law,&rdquo; said Cynthia Dennis, RN, coordinator of prevention for Safe Kids Northeast Florida, led by THE PLAYERS Center for Child Health at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>Go through several practice runs before your baby arrives, and get the car seat inspected to ensure that it&rsquo;s properly installed. Safe Kids Northeast Florida offers a <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/car-safety\">Safe Kids Buckle Up&reg; inspection station</a> featuring free car and booster seat installation checks by certified child passenger safety technicians.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Asthma is a chronic disease that causes the airways to become irritated and inflamed. Symptoms include coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing and chest pain. It can be intermittent, or it can interfere with daily life.</p><p>Asthma is the No. 1 reason children miss school. In some cases, asthma can even lead to a life-threatening attack.</p><p>Kerry Hogan, BSN, RN, asthma educator with <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/child-advocacy\" target=\"_blank\">THE PLAYERS Center for Child Health at Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital</a>, teaches families of hospitalized patients with asthma that proper management of the condition starts at home. Taking a few precautions in each room of the house can drastically reduce the number of possible triggers for kids.</p><p><strong>Living room</strong></p><p>The main culprit for triggering asthma in the living area is fabric: rugs, carpet and cloth-covered furniture all have fibers that trap irritants such as dust mites. These microscopic insects feed on dead human skin, both of which work their ways into furniture and fabrics around the house. That&rsquo;s where these bugs usually take up residence. The mites&rsquo; waste and body parts are allergens for many people.</p><p>&ldquo;Carpet holds onto dust mites, pet dander and other irritants. The best thing parents can do in a home with carpet is to vacuum at least one to two times a week,&rdquo; said Hogan. She added that vacuuming stirs up irritants, so during cleanup, have children with asthma play outside, visit a friend&rsquo;s house or at least stay out of the recently vacuumed room for a few hours.</p><p>&ldquo;Purchasing a vacuum with a HEPA filter will also help capture more of those irritants out of the air,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><strong>Kitchen</strong></p><p>Proper food storage is important for many reasons, but if a child with asthma lives in the home, it takes on a whole new importance. Cockroaches are attracted to trash cans and improperly stored food.</p><p>&ldquo;When cockroaches poop, their feces become a white powdery substance and it can irritate the airways,&rdquo; said Hogan. &ldquo;Take your garbage out frequently and don&rsquo;t leave open food on the counter. Make sure snacks are stored in an airtight container. We just want to decrease what could be attracting them as much as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>If roaches do creep in, she recommends avoiding aerosol bug sprays to kill pests indoors, and sticking to gel repellants or poison baits instead.</p><p>Foods high in sulfites are known to trigger asthma flare-ups as well. Examples include dried fruit, processed potatoes and shrimp. Hogan suggests becoming familiar with sulfite-laden snacks and not purchasing them for home.</p><p><strong>Bathroom</strong></p><p>Mold isn&rsquo;t good for anyone, but it can be especially dangerous for those with asthma. <a href=\"http://www.communityasthmajax.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Community Asthma Partnership at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a> recommends fixing leaky pipes immediately, and cleaning moldy surfaces with a bleach-based product.</p><div class=\"u-size2of2 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05 u-padRight06\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1532353034/Juice/WCH-Juice_Asthma-Proof_Home_Infographic_v02.jpg\" alt=\"How to Asthma-proof your home\"></div><p>&ldquo;Black or green mold can be a problem,&rdquo; said Hogan. &ldquo;We ask parents to check under sinks and around the faucets. If there is a mold problem, have the child leave before cleaning so airborne spores don&rsquo;t cause a flare-up. Many of our families rent and they can&rsquo;t treat it alone, so if that is the case contact your landlord immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>When using scented hair products, toiletries or perfumes, avoid strong odors and sprays. The pungent smells can irritate a child&rsquo;s asthma even hours after use. Be especially careful if the child is in the room during usage.</p><p>&ldquo;Strong scents can irritate the airways because of the chemicals in them. We remind people not to use those, or things like Febreze and plug-ins, especially when children are in the room,&rdquo; added Hogan.</p><p><strong>Bedroom</strong></p><p>A child&rsquo;s bedroom is where they spend anywhere from eight to 13 hours a day, and that&rsquo;s only while sleeping. It may be even more if they spend time here playing or doing homework. Because of this, their bedroom may be one of the most important rooms to make asthma-friendly.</p><p>A good place to start is with a laundry routine. &ldquo;We recommend washing all of the bedding about once a week in hot water. Stuffed animals are a big issue for kids, so try to limit them to one or two in the bedroom. You can wash your stuffed animals just the same as your bedding, so toss them in too,&rdquo; said Hogan.</p><p>As for the pillows and mattress, dust mite-proof cases help will keep these tiny creatures from moving in and causing irritation during the night.</p><p>And when it comes to pets, keep Fido and Fluffy out of the bedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;A dog, cat or any animal with a lot of dander is going to make asthma worse. We understand that most families don&rsquo;t want their pets living outside, but at least keep it out of the child&rsquo;s bedroom since they&rsquo;re sleeping in there for extended periods,&rdquo; said Hogan.</p><p><strong>Outside only</strong></p><p>When it comes to asthma triggers, there is one thing Hogan says should never be allowed into the house.</p><p>&ldquo;Smoke is our biggest concern for children with asthma &mdash; it&rsquo;s the No. 1 trigger,&rdquo; said Hogan. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t allow anyone to smoke inside your home because carpet and furniture fabric can hold the nicotine molecules inside. When someone comes back in from smoking outside, have them change their shirt or jacket so it&rsquo;s not clinging to their clothing. That&rsquo;s how a lot of our patients end up having their attacks.&rdquo;</p><p><br></p><p><em>Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital is one of four Asthma-Friendly Hospitals in the state, designated by The Florida Asthma Coalition. The Asthma-Friendly Hospital designation is awarded to hospitals that excel in asthma management, reducing health risks for asthma patients and preventing and minimizing asthma-related ER visits and hospitalizations.</em></p>",

In spite of having to travel two-and-a-half hours each way to clinic visits, they wanted to remain with Dr. Aldana.</p><p>&ldquo;We knew we were in the best care and we didn&rsquo;t want to change,&rdquo; Nance said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t care &ndash; I would drive anywhere to see Dr. Aldana.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>A new concern</strong></p><p>Hope continued to see Dr. Aldana every three months and the mass remained the same until December 2017, when the MRI and CT scan showed the mass had grown to the size of a large peanut.</p><p>Dr. Aldana confirmed it was a low-grade astrocytoma (Level II) and recommended Hope have it removed surgically.</p><p>Many different types of brain tumors can affect children and teenagers, and they are among the most common types of childhood cancers. The symptoms of a tumor will depend upon the location inside the skull, the size of the tumor and the structures that the tumor is pressing upon or changing.&nbsp;</p><p>Hope returned to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital in January 2018 to remove the tumor. Using an intraoperative MRI, technology available at only a few children&rsquo;s hospitals in the country, Dr. Aldana was able to get a better view of the tumor during surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;The intraoperative MRI scans the brain in the middle of the surgery to determine if any of the tumor has been left behind or if the tumor is completely removed,&rdquo; Dr. Aldana said. &ldquo;It is better to take the extra steps during the procedure than having to bring the patient back for another surgery.&rdquo;</p><p>In non-medical terms, Dr. Aldana removed the non-cancerous brain tumor.</p><p>Thankfully, Hope doesn&rsquo;t require any further treatment, but will need an MRI every three months for the next two to three years to monitor for any changes following the surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to thank Dr. Aldana and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital for making a difference,&rdquo; Nance said. &ldquo;He was compassionate and caring, and I have a great appreciation for all that he did for Hope and our family.&rdquo;</p><p>Services provided at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital are provided primarily by pediatric physician specialists with Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, and the University of Florida College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Over the last 30 years, the rate of childhood obesity in the United States has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in teens, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Put more simply, one out of three children and adolescents in our country is either overweight or obese. But did you know that one of the main reasons is that parents are setting examples for their kids by making unhealthy lifestyle choices themselves?</p><p>Pediatric clinical psychologist Terrie Andrews, PhD, administrator for <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>, said that first and foremost, parents must eat nutritious foods and maintain a healthy lifestyle because their habits and routines are most definitely handed down to their children.</p><p>&ldquo;If parents are eating poorly and not exercising, the likelihood increases that their children will do the same. Parents have to take an active role in setting an example of a healthy lifestyle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Stay healthy, take care of yourself and exercise, and your children will follow suit.&rdquo;</p><p>Sitting down at the dinner table and sharing a nutritious meal with your children is beneficial not only because it&rsquo;s a great way to spend quality time together, but because research shows that kids find food more appealing when it&rsquo;s presented to them in a positive setting, she added.</p><p>Another downfall is the lack of healthy food choices available at home for kids to eat. Stocking the pantry with processed, high-carb and sugar-filled foods like chips, cookies and sugary cereals instead of fruits and vegetables is a sure way to set them up for poor nutrition and eating habits that will very likely follow them right into adulthood. If there are certain foods your children aren&rsquo;t allowed to have, never hide or eat them in front of your kids.</p><p>&ldquo;That can lead to resentment and entitlement,&rdquo; said Dr. Andrews. &ldquo;If you can have those foods, why can&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p><p>While she admits it&rsquo;s not easy to eat healthy all of the time, each meal can make a difference toward that goal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lifestyle, not a diet. If you feel that you failed during a particular meal, try again at the next one,&rdquo; said Dr. Andrews.</p><p>Here are some health risks for overweight kids: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li>&bull; High blood pressure and high cholesterol, both risk factors for heart disease</li><li>&bull; Increased risk of Type 2 diabetes</li><li>&bull; Breathing problems like sleep apnea and asthma</li><li>&bull; Joint problems</li><li>&bull; Fatty liver disease, gallstones and heartburn</li><li>&bull; Depression, low self-esteem and behavioral problems</li><li>&bull; Problems with social, physical and emotional functioning</li></ul>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>In the United States, approximately six million children have some kind of food allergy, 90 percent of which are caused by milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy and wheat. Some children develop an allergy to a particular type of food or foods while they are still babies, while it can be more gradual for others.</p><p>If you have a toddler and are unaware that he or she has a food allergy, there are certain symptoms to look for, like a stuffy or itchy nose after eating a particular food, but some are hard to pick up on.</p><p>&ldquo;Those are symptoms that are usually ignored,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatric-allergist-and-immunologist/dr-ejaz-yousef-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ejaz Yousef, MD</a>, chief of Allergy and Immunology for Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, and a pediatric allergist with <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>. &ldquo;So it helps to know if your child is more at risk for developing a food allergy than others.&rdquo;</p><p>For example, if your child has a skin condition like eczema, there is a higher likelihood of him or her being sensitive to certain foods. Likewise, kids with asthma, especially those who have difficulty keeping it under control, are at greater risk of having a severe reaction.</p><p>Food allergies are caused by an immune-related response to proteins in the food that can cause reactions such as hives, itching, nasal congestion, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing, tongue swelling and even loss of blood pressure.</p><p>&ldquo;There are four systems that usually get involved: skin, respiratory, digestive and cardiovascular,&rdquo; said. &ldquo;Anaphylaxis is an allergic reaction that involves two or more of these systems in the body, and anaphylactic shock -- the most severe and life-threatening -- is when the blood pressure is involved.&rdquo;</p><p>For toddlers who do have an established food allergy, keeping them away from the wrong foods can sometimes be a challenge, especially if you&rsquo;re away from home at a party or a friend&rsquo;s house. Toddlers are especially at risk in these types of situations because they get into things that they shouldn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s easy when food is sitting out or when hosts don&rsquo;t realize there&rsquo;s an allergy.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much easier to control ingredients when food is prepared at home where you can read food labels, confidently knowing exactly what you are giving your child,&rdquo; said Jodi Ervin, RD, a registered dietitian with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. &ldquo;But if you do venture out, taking along a dish you prepared at home is a great idea because you know what&rsquo;s in it. Toting back-up snacks and drinks with you in a cooler or a bag for your child to munch on is another smart idea that really pays off if you end up staying somewhere longer than expected.&rdquo;</p><p>If your toddler attends day care or pre-school, making sure that caregivers are aware of the allergy and that they know what to do in case of an emergency is very important. The use of an epinephrine auto-injector needs to be immediate once a child eats something that&rsquo;s been known to cause a reaction in the past or if he or she begins to have a reaction. Children are also more vulnerable to a serious attack if the use of an epinephrine injection is delayed, and sometimes one rescue injection isn&rsquo;t enough because it only lasts about 30 minutes.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>When 7-year-old Cole woke up at 2:30 am on May 8 with a croup-like cough, his mom Donna Johnson wasn&rsquo;t all that worried. After all, her son had experienced croup &ndash; an upper airway infection that is often accompanied by a barking cough like Cole had &ndash; in the past and cold air allayed his symptoms then.</p><p>She took her son outside to get some fresh air to see if that would help, but it didn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;I gave him some cough medicine and had him sitting up and taking deep breaths to get him settled down,&rdquo; Johnson, of Hahira, Ga., remembered. &ldquo;He was just a little short of breath at first, but 30 minutes later, he started coughing again. I knew he needed to go to the emergency room, but when I saw blood on the edge of his mouth, I immediately called 911.&rdquo;</p><p>Johnson took Cole back outside to wait for the ambulance. &ldquo;His breathing was becoming very hard and he was no longer coughing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had my arm around his waist and put my hand under his chin, holding him up so he could breathe. He was sweating and he looked like he about to pass out. He was turning a washed-out, gray color and he was so scared, so I started singing his favorite song to him, &lsquo;Joy to the World.&rsquo; But I was getting really, really scared.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>What seemed routine became life-threatening</strong></p><p>The ambulance arrived, and paramedics gave him an oxygen treatment.</p><p>&ldquo;When we got to South Georgia Medical Center [in Valdosta], they thought Cole had pneumonia in both lungs, but his breathing was getting worse and worse and worse,&rdquo; said Johnson. &ldquo;The ER doctor said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like to do this with anyone but an adult, but I have to intubate your son. It is so hard for him to breathe that if we don&rsquo;t do it now, we won&rsquo;t have a choice but to do it later.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Donna and her husband, Mark Johnson, agreed to the procedure, and the doctor sedated Cole. &ldquo;They started pumping blood and stuff out of his lung,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The doctor said, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on, and there is no Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at South Georgia Medical Center, so we have to get him somewhere else.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>South Georgia Medical Center contacted <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville</a>, which sent a team to transport Cole from Valdosta to Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/emergency/critical-care-transport\" target=\"_blank\">Kids Kare Mobile ICU transport team&nbsp;</a>with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital was dispatched, flying in on the LifeFlight air ambulance.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when it got real,&rdquo; said Johnson, who took photos and video with her phone of her son being loaded up. &ldquo;We watched until we couldn&rsquo;t see the helicopter anymore, and then my husband and I drove to Jacksonville.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Trying to find answers</strong></p><p>Cole was admitted directly to the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/supporting-services/picu\" target=\"_blank\">Pediatric ICU</a> at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, which is where he was when the Johnsons arrived.</p><p>&ldquo;They tested for everything under the sun,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;They did blood cultures, viral and bacterial, for 24 hours but we still had no idea what was going on. Dr. [Karen] Lidksy [medical director over Pediatric Neurointensive Care at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s], consulted with a pediatric ear, nose and throat physician, Dr. [Angela] Black, who said she wanted to do an exploratory scope in the OR to look for airway abnormalities or injury.&rdquo;</p><p>During the endoscopic procedure, Dr. Black found that Cole&rsquo;s tonsils were so swollen that the only thing that had kept the boy&rsquo;s trachea open was being intubated.</p><p>The ER doctor&rsquo;s decision back in Valdosta may have saved Cole&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Black said she wanted to take his tonsils out right away. She told us he had the largest tonsils she had ever seen on a child,&rdquo; Johnson remembered.</p><p>After removing Cole&rsquo;s tonsils, doctors decided to keep him intubated and sedated for 24 hours after surgery, checking his blood gas levels and making sure everything was alright.</p><p>Soon, Cole required only nasal oxygen and then was soon breathing on his own. He was discharged from Wolfson Children&rsquo;s on a Saturday, and was back to school that following Thursday.</p><p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t able to find a reason why his tonsils were so swollen,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if he was allergic to something or what. He was diagnosed with negative-pressure pulmonary edema [where the lungs fill up with fluid when they are trying to expand against an obstruction (tonsils)].&rdquo;</p><p>Despite not having clear-cut answers about what led to Cole&rsquo;s severe case of tonsillitis, Johnson knows one thing to be true. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t his time to go.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Reunited, and it feels so good!</strong></p><p>Although Cole doesn&rsquo;t remember his helicopter ride because he was sedated, he was very interested in seeing the helicopter that transported him from Valdosta to Jacksonville. He also asked his mom if he could meet the people who saved his life. The reunion, held on June 28, 2018, was arranged by Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and Air Methods, which owns the LifeFlight helicopter that was used for transport.</p><p>Cole&#39;s family couldn&#39;t be more grateful for the care he received, and for the opportunity to meet the crews and take tours of the helicopter and the Kids Kare unit. &quot;It&#39;s a day we&#39;ll never forget!&quot; said Johnson before the family headed back to Hahira.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Everyone I&rsquo;ve ever known who is raising a child longs for three things above all &ndash; for their child to be healthy, safe and happy.</p><p>But no matter how well families provide for the children entrusted to their care, there are no guarantees. Being a kid has never been easy, but to speak of adolescent drama today means something completely different than it did not that long ago. No child is exempt from the fear of school shootings, the anxiety of testing or the competitive comparisons of social media. And it&rsquo;s taking an increasing toll on our community&rsquo;s youth.</p><p>According to the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey of Duval County students administered by the CDC:<br>&bull; More than 1 in 3 high school students experienced depression, a 24 percent increase since 2013.<br>&bull; 1 in 4 middle school students seriously considered suicide, 1 in 5 made a plan and 1 in 8 attempted to die by suicide, a 21 percent increase since 2013.<br>&bull; 1 in 5 high school students seriously considered suicide, made a plan and attempted to die by suicide.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not only depression, of course. The CDC reports 1 in 5 American children ages 3 through 17 have a diagnosable mental, emotional or behavioral disorder. However, 80 percent of these children are not diagnosed and therefore don&rsquo;t receive the help they need, even if they had access.</p><p>Now more than ever, it&rsquo;s important that kids be equipped to utilize the visual and performing arts as a means of self-expression, perseverance and finding purpose. Young people often feel safer expressing traumatic experiences and uncomfortable feelings through the arts than through traditional therapies.</p><p>When kids get to experience the arts, it changes their experience of life.</p><p>When kids see that they can create something &ndash; whether it is a monologue, movement with their body, a piece of art or a musical performance &ndash; that sense of self-efficacy increases their self-worth, resilience and determination to keep putting the pieces together to create meaning and positive change.</p><p>When kids aren&rsquo;t sure of what they are feeling, the arts provide a vehicle for them to explore, process and express a whole range of emotions. The arts help children find their voice and use it wisely.</p><p>Neuroscience shows observing or participating in the arts increases dopamine and activates reward centers of the brain. Blood flow to the prefrontal cortex, which regulates our feelings, thoughts and actions, increases when participating in the arts. That which stirs the soul literally stirs the mind.</p><p>Anyone who watched the drama students who survived the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., perform at the Tony Awards last month saw how they drew strength, comfort and hope from participating in the arts.</p><p>At their worst, the arts can be reduced to decoration and sentimentality, but at their best, they can be a transforming force. The arts possess the power to do in us what we sometimes simply cannot do on our own.</p><p><em>Our guest columnist is the Reverend Kimberly L.

The scary machines, the pokey needles, all the strangers coming in and out of the room&mdash;it can be overwhelming for even the toughest of kids.</p><p>&ldquo;We are trained to read their body language, their response to our questions, to notice if their demeanor changes&mdash;all of that helps us know if this kiddo is really OK, or if they might have some anxiety about what is going on,&rdquo; White said.</p><p>For her tonsillectomy patient, White pulls out her teaching tools: a breathing mask and some electrode stickers, along with other items the child might see during her procedure. Her tablet holds pictures of the operating room and she dives right in, explaining to her patient what she is about to experience in an age-appropriate way.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t say things like &lsquo;This is the worst part&rsquo; or &lsquo;This won&rsquo;t hurt&rsquo; because that might not be true,&rdquo; White said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to scare our patients, but we don&rsquo;t want to lie to them, either. We want them to trust us, and if we say that they won&rsquo;t feel any pain and they do, then that trust is completely broken.&rdquo;</p><p>The young girl asks a few questions about the strange machines she sees in the pictures and puts the breathing mask over her face to see how it feels. She asks White if she will walk back to the operating room with her. &ldquo;I tell you what,&rdquo; White answered, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s walk back together and watch some shows on my tablet. Would you like that?&rdquo; The patient responds with a smile and an enthusiastic head nod.</p><p>White leaves her patient to grab a few goodies from her stash of toys&mdash;a deck of cards, a coloring book and some markers. &ldquo;Play is a wonderful tool,&rdquo; said White. &ldquo;It gives them something to do and takes their mind off what&rsquo;s going on or what is about to happen.&rdquo;</p><p>White returns, play tools in hand, to her patient&rsquo;s room, where the once fidgeting fingers are now calm, the quiet girl now laughing.</p><p><strong>Music therapy</strong></p><p>Julie Avirett is a music therapist at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. Through consultations and referrals, Avirett serves patients throughout the entire hospital. On this day, she&rsquo;s making a second visit to a 4-year-old boy who is recovering from major leg surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;He had a significant decrease in his pain scale after the first session,&rdquo; said Avirett, while tuning her guitar. &ldquo;He responded really well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you feel today?&rdquo; she asks her patient. &ldquo;I feel happy. But my leg is sad,&rdquo; comes the reply. So Avirett starts playing the boy&#39;s favorite song, &ldquo;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.&rdquo; After a few choruses, he starts to smile and sing along, rocking back and forth with the tune.</p><p>&ldquo;There are several ways music can help with pain management,&rdquo; Avirett said. &ldquo;It encourages breath control and it&rsquo;s an active engagement to distract them if they are younger, or you can use relaxation and imagery if they are older.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We are so grateful for this program,&rdquo; smiles the patient&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;He loves music, and when I saw Julie walking down the hall with her guitar, I knew we had to have a visit.&rdquo;</p><p>Child Life specialists and music therapists are invaluable members of a patient&#39;s care team, however long their hospital stay may be.</p><p><strong>Calming agents</strong></p><p>Child Life specialist Christine Licsko works on the hematology/oncology floor in the Weaver Tower.

What might comfort one child might not work for another. A patient might curl into a ball while I&rsquo;m explaining a procedure and that&rsquo;s a sign that I need to back off and not talk about it anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>When in doubt, Child Life specialists can always turn to their leader, Pat Kirkland, for guidance. As the manager of Family Support Services, Kirkland meets regularly with the Child Life team to provide crucial support.</p><p>&ldquo;We check in with her to talk about a difficult case or to make sure we&rsquo;re all practicing self-care techniques,&rdquo; Licsko said.</p><p>From tonsillectomies to bone marrow transplants, Child Life specialists are there to guide patients and their families through a potentially scary time.</p><p>Said Licsko: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to make their stay go as smoothly as possible.&rdquo;</p><p><em>How can you help?&nbsp;</em><em>Child Life specialists rely on donations to ensure they have everything they need for their patients.

As a parent, making these decisions can be tough. Here are nine ways Mom or Dad can determine when to let the symptoms pass and when to take them seriously, along with what to bring, ask and do next when they get to the ER.</p><p>1. <strong>Your child&rsquo;s doctor can help you decide</strong>. If you&rsquo;re not sure if it&rsquo;s an emergency, your pediatrician&rsquo;s office is typically available 24/7 and can advise if you should go to the ER right away.</p><p>2. <strong>A children&rsquo;s ER is different</strong>. An ER affiliated with a children&rsquo;s hospital has the specially trained staff to handle serious issues that may arise from seemingly minor symptoms.</p><p>3. <strong>Be calm and clear</strong>. Even if your heart is racing, staying calm will help your child feel less anxious, and you&rsquo;ll be able to communicate more clearly to those who can help.</p><p>4.<strong>&nbsp;Bring your child&rsquo;s health history</strong>. The ER doctor will need to know about immunizations, previous illnesses, current health conditions, allergies and medications. Keep the information in your purse or diaper bag, along with his health insurance card.</p><p>5. <strong>Give the ER team all the facts</strong>. Information about your child&rsquo;s symptoms, when the first one appeared, how an injury occurred, etc. will help the ER doctor diagnose and treat your child more quickly.</p><p>6. <strong>Tell your child what to expect</strong>. Let her know that the ER doctor (not her regular doctor) will examine her, and may need to run special tests to help her feel better sooner.</p><p>7. <strong>Ask questions</strong>. You are your child&rsquo;s best advocate and the ER team&rsquo;s partner in care. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask for more information about the plan of care if you have concerns.</p><p>8. <strong>Get clear discharge instructions</strong>. Make sure you know what to do to take care of your child once he&rsquo;s home from the ER.</p><p>9. <strong>Follow up with your child&rsquo;s doctor</strong>. It&rsquo;s a good idea to update your child&rsquo;s medical history and to make a follow-up appointment.</p><p><em>For a list of Wolfson Children&#39;s Emergency Center locations, visit <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/emergency\" target=\"_blank\">wolfsonchildrens.com/ER</a>.

Landmann, MD, chief of Colon &amp; Rectal Surgery at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>.</p><p>After an accident several years ago, Spiegel started experiencing pain at the base of her spine. She assumed it would go away as her body healed, but it didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>When the pain continued for months, then years, Spiegel sought a diagnosis from a Miami neurosurgeon who told her, &ldquo;I know exactly what you have, and you need to have it removed immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>Turns out, a tennis ball-size tumor was slowly growing in the space directly below the lowest part of her spine (called the presacral). In the beginning stages, these tumors rarely cause symptoms and are usually discovered by accident or during another diagnostic procedure.</p><p>Presacral tumors are rare enough that most colorectal surgeons see only one a year, said Dr. Landmann. Given his referral practice from throughout the Southeast U.S., Dr. Landmann treats several each year.</p><p>&ldquo;Because they are not common, you really want someone with high-volume experience and specialization,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These tumors can be complex to take out, and the surgery has the potential to damage organs if not done properly.&rdquo;</p><p>Some tumor removals may even require a multidisciplinary approach with orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons and vascular surgeons, and others may benefit from the use of a surgical robot to remove the tumor through the abdomen, he added.</p><p>As soon as Spiegel knew her diagnosis, Google reinforced the surgical risks.</p><p>She wanted a cancer surgeon who had expertise in this kind of tumor removal. It took her almost a year to find the right doctor. After meeting with several surgeons near her hometown in Miami Beach, she felt she needed to continue looking.</p><p>Spiegel found Dr. Landmann&rsquo;s biography online while he was in the process of transitioning from his previous employer to the Baptist MD Anderson team. She flew up to Jacksonville to meet with him, and he spent an hour reviewing her MRIs and explaining the surgery.</p><p>Because of his job transition, Dr. Landmann told Spiegel she&rsquo;d find great surgeons at his previous hospital &mdash; or even in her hometown, if she wanted to stay close to Miami Beach.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But, I had to leave South Florida to find the surgeon I wanted,&rdquo; Spiegel said. &ldquo;Knowing he was moving, I told him, &lsquo;Please, take me with you.&#39;&rdquo;</p><p>She appreciated that he didn&rsquo;t put any pressure on where she elected to have the surgery. More importantly, as he looked at her MRI images, he showed them to her and explained in detail what they were looking at and how to resolve the problem. The brief &lsquo;tutorial,&rsquo; complete with a question-and-answer session, was exactly what the South Florida lawyer needed to be put at ease.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a standard of care for us to be personal and humanistic, and to treat every patient as if they are our family members,&rdquo; Dr. Landmann said. &ldquo;Our patients are going through one of the most difficult challenges of their lives, and we have to guide them and their family through the process.&rdquo;</p><p>Shortly after Dr. Landmann arrived at Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center in Jacksonville, so did Spiegel.</p><p>Her surgery took place on Tuesday, June 5, 2018. Even though the procedure was slated to last five hours, it was over in less than three.</p><p>&ldquo;The most difficult part of my surgery was being a passenger as my husband drove us home from Jacksonville to Miami Beach as my little dog sat on my lap,&rdquo; Spiegel said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scheduled for a check-up, and then that&rsquo;s it. Hopefully, I won&rsquo;t ever need to come back [to Jacksonville] again, but if necessary, I do have [Dr. Landmann&#39;s] number.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Landmann doesn&rsquo;t expect Spiegel to need him in the future. The tumor, although sizable, was perfectly spherical and was removed completely intact.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I felt, based on my prior experience, that we could get a great outcome &mdash; a quick, safe and efficient operation with good long-term results,&rdquo; Dr. Landmann said.</p><p>Less than a month after her surgery, Spiegel was able to take her one-eyed Chihuahua-terrier mix, Sammy Davis, III, for a walk around her block.</p><p>Dr. Landmann now refers to Spiegel by her hero, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg &ndash;&quot;RBG&quot; for short &ndash; who they talked about on occasion throughout Spiegel&rsquo;s treatment. &ldquo;For Henri, my &#39;RBG,&#39; we went through the pre-, intra- and post-operative process in a controlled, orderly and judicious fashion &ndash; with just a sprinkle of humor. It helped put her mind at ease &ndash; and made my job even more fun and rewarding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Every day, I feel exponentially better,&rdquo; Spiegel said.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Andrew Roberts, 13, lives in Fleming Island with his mom, Tracy Killebrew. The soon-to-be 8th grader at St. Johns Classical Academy enjoys hunting and all things tech. And he is already enjoying his summer vacation.</p><p>Looking at him now, you&rsquo;d never know what he has survived to get where he is &mdash; he nearly drowned at just two years old. Drowning is the leading cause of death for children between the ages of one and four years old.</p><p>For Andrew, his near-death incident isn&rsquo;t a defining part of his life. It&rsquo;s simply a lesson he hopes to share with parents and guardians of small children, like his younger self.</p><p>Andrew was spending the weekend with his dad and was enjoying the pool with a relative, who looked away for a split second. In that brief moment, Andrew took one step too far into the deep end.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember seeing the light above me, and then I blacked out,&rdquo; said Roberts.</p><p>Back at her house, Killebrew was folding laundry when she got the call. &ldquo;It was Andrew&rsquo;s aunt, his dad&rsquo;s sister, saying that Andrew had been taken to Wolfson [Children&#39;s Hospital] because there was an accident in the pool and he almost drowned,&rdquo; she remembered. &ldquo;I called my sister immediately to drive me downtown because I was way too upset to drive. When I got to the ER, he was as white as a ghost.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05 u-padRight06\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1530885184/Juice/Andrew_Roberts-drowning.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Roberts, a 15-year-old advocate for water safety\"></div><p>Andrew had been taken by ambulance to the Life Flight helicopter, and then brought to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Jacksonville. He recovered over the weekend and was released just two days later. He hadn&rsquo;t been deprived of oxygen long enough to experience any effects to his brain, but it was time to take preventive measures.</p><p>&ldquo;I decided we were going to be proactive. He&rsquo;s going to know how to swim and how to get to the edge of the pool,&rdquo; Killebrew recalled. &ldquo;The Fleming Island High School swim coach reached out to me and said she was willing to give Andrew survival swim lessons. It wasn&rsquo;t even three months and he was back in the pool. He was like a fish in water after that. I would say if you&rsquo;re going to be near a swimming pool, get them lessons.&rdquo;</p><p>Today, Andrew has no fear. He loves going diving, being around the ocean, and says he &ldquo;can&rsquo;t get enough of the water.&rdquo; He said survival skills are vital for young children, especially in Florida, and so is being attentive if you&rsquo;re the adult on watch.</p><p>&ldquo;Adults shouldn&rsquo;t leave their kids alone or be on their phones,&rdquo; Andrew said. &ldquo;They need to be watching what their kids are doing, and having fun with them in the pool. You don&rsquo;t have to have the experience I did.&rdquo;</p><p>Cynthia Dennis, RN, coordinator of Safe Kids Northeast Florida, seconds Andrew&rsquo;s advice to parents.</p><p>&ldquo;In 2017, 40 children were treated at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital as a result of drowning, and all of those incidents were preventable,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The common denominator is a lack of adult supervision, whether a parent turns their back for just a minute or the child is unsupervised and finds a body of water to get into. Drowning is a silent event and it takes two minutes or less for a child to lose consciousness when submerged. For that reason, constant visual supervision must be maintained at all times when kids are in and around the water.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>5 Tips for Safe Swimming from Safe Kids Northeast Florida&rsquo;s&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.com/about/water-safety\"><strong>Lifeguard Your Child</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;Campaign</strong></p><p><strong>1. Actively supervise children in the pool.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Give swimming children your undivided attention. At a swim gathering, at least one adult should be the designated &quot;Water Watcher.&quot; A Water Watcher sits within arm&rsquo;s reach and does nothing else but keep his or her eyes on the kids, constantly. At a party, parents and other adults can take 15-minute shifts. Keep hands on infants and young children who can&rsquo;t swim yet.</p><p><strong>2. Make it difficult for a child to get into the pool unsupervised.</strong></p><p>Backyard pools should be fully enclosed in fencing at least four-feet high, with a self-closing, self-latching gate. Install an alarm to sound if the gate is opened. When using inflatable or portable pools, remember to empty them immediately after use and store them upside down, out of children&rsquo;s reach.</p><p><strong>3. Learn CPR.</strong></p><p>Parents and other adult caregivers should learn CPR, especially if children will be swimming at home rather than at community pools staffed by trained lifeguards. If you think your older children would benefit, have them attend lessons, too.</p><p><strong>4. Be wary of pool drains.</strong></p><p>Teach your children to avoid swimming near pool drains or suction outlets to avoid entrapment. Have a licensed swimming pool professional inspect your pool or spa at home, and immediately replace any broken, missing or loose drain covers.</p><p><strong>5. Teach kids about swimming safety.</strong></p><p>Enroll your child in swimming lessons so they can learn to tread water, float and get to the edge of the pool. Keep them in swimming lessons to learn all they can and to develop strength and endurance. Look for the &quot;Learn to Swim&quot; box at <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/water-safety\" target=\"_blank\">wolfsonchildrens.com/water</a> for information on where to get swimming lessons locally.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/advocacy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Safe Kids Northeast Florida</em></a><em>&nbsp;is led by THE PLAYERS Center at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Mental illness doesn&rsquo;t discriminate. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), more than six million men experience depression on a daily basis and three million struggle with anxiety, but only one in four of them speak with a medical professional.&nbsp;</p><p>Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rank suicide as the seventh leading cause of death for men, who are four times more likely to die by suicide than women. It&rsquo;s the second most common cause of death for men ages 10 through 39.</p><p><strong>Keeping Quiet</strong></p><p>If so many men are affected by mental illness, why are they seeking professional help less frequently and resorting to suicide more often than women?</p><p>&ldquo;Societal norms,&rdquo; explained John Repique, DNP, RN, a psychiatric nurse and system director of Inpatient Behavioral Health at Baptist Health. &ldquo;Traditionally, women are viewed as more in tune with their emotions, while men are supposed to present a strong fa&ccedil;ade that doesn&rsquo;t convey emotions. Our society makes it seem like a sign of weakness if men show emotion. We have this culture that tends to overvalue hyper-masculinity and says that men aren&rsquo;t supposed to express their feelings &mdash; they&rsquo;re supposed to bottle it up.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Repique believes this stigma &mdash; men who express their emotions are weak &mdash; may be part of the reason they aren&rsquo;t seeking medical attention and being diagnosed with mental health conditions as often as women. And just how heart attacks have different symptoms for men and women, signs of mental illnesses can differ between the sexes.</p><p><strong>Recognizing Symptoms</strong></p><p>For example, men with depression are more likely to exhibit reckless decision-making or more frequent use of alcohol rather than sadness or changes in body weight. Diagnosis rates could also be impacted by how men are reporting their symptoms.</p><p>&ldquo;Women, who are more practiced at recognizing and talking about their emotions, are more likely to report feeling prolonged sadness,&rdquo; said Dr. Repique. &ldquo;They tend to have a greater awareness of how their emotional health is related to their physical health. When men go to their physicians, they are more focused on physical symptoms. They&rsquo;ll note things like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m having insomnia,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;m having low energy.&rsquo; They&rsquo;re not correlating that with emotional health.&quot;</p><p><strong>Making A Change</strong></p><p>For men who may have concerns about their well-being, mental health care providers say it&rsquo;s crucial to stop manning up, and opt for opening up instead.</p><p>&ldquo;One way to do this is to make sure men are educated about mental health,&rdquo; recommended Dr. Repique. &ldquo;For example, depression is not just sadness &mdash; it&rsquo;s prolonged. If you are not recovering from it after a matter of weeks and it impairs your functioning, then it&rsquo;s time to get help. If you have the education, you&rsquo;re more aware of when to seek help.&rdquo;</p><p>He added, &ldquo;Another piece of advice is for men to do self-checks. There are three things you need to ask yourself. One, what are your thoughts about? Two, are they mostly negative or pessimistic? And three, have your body and behavior changed?&rdquo;</p><p>If a man decides to visit his doctor but is unsure how to broach the subject of mental health, it may be helpful to cite an example.</p><p>&ldquo;To me, celebrities and professional athletes coming out publicly to talk about their depression are a big help. When a man goes to his primary care physician, he might be able to use that example to strike up that conversation with his doctor,&rdquo; said Repique.</p><p>And of course, having a support system is vital.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to have a buddy you feel comfortable talking to about your innermost thoughts and feelings. They could be a friend, a family member or your partner,&rdquo; Dr. Repique said. &ldquo;Men need to know there is nothing wrong with talking about your emotions. It takes strength to feel and express your emotions, because if you don&rsquo;t, it could lead to more tragic consequences.&rdquo;</p><p>If you or a loved one is interested in learning more about mental health, please check out Baptist Health&#39;s upcoming free Mental Health First Aid courses.</p><p><br></p><p><em>To register for Mental Health First Aid or find additional class dates, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://jaxmentalhealth.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>jaxmentalhealth.org</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>A recent news story reported the sad news that the 19-month-old daughter of Olympic gold medalist Bode Miller drowned in a pool accident. Unfortunately, this is the time of year when child drowning stories are in the news. Drowning is the leading cause of death among children under five, according to the Centers for Disease Control, and Florida leads the nation in the number of children who die from accidental drownings.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Toddlers are curious. They&rsquo;re drawn to the water and they&rsquo;re quick,&rdquo; said Cynthia Dennis, RN, coordinator, Safe Kids Northeast Florida, led by THE PLAYERS Center for Child Health. &ldquo;And drowning is silent &ndash; you won&rsquo;t hear a child splashing around or yelling under water.&rdquo;</p><p>It takes less than two minutes for a child to lose consciousness in the water.</p><p>&ldquo;You must keep your eyes on kids in the water at all times &ndash; nothing less than constant visual supervision,&rdquo; Dennis said.</p><p>Because it&rsquo;s easy to assume someone else in the group is watching, Dennis recommends the &ldquo;Water Watcher&rdquo; system, where adults take turns being the designated supervisor. &ldquo;This person agrees to focus 100 percent on the kids and be at arms&rsquo; length reach with no distractions,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>The designated adult wears a Water Watcher tag. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have a tag, improvise with a big silly hat or something that makes it obvious who is watching,&rdquo; recommended Dennis. You can order a free Water Watcher tag and other water safety items by calling 904.202.4302.</p><p>As with the Bode Miller tragedy, children often gain access to water through an unlocked door that leads to a pool. That&rsquo;s why multiple barriers to the water are necessary. &ldquo;Place a lock that is out of reach of children on any door or window leading to a pool,&rdquo; Dennis recommended. She also recommends audible alarms on doors and windows and, of course, a protective, locked gate around pool&rsquo;s perimeter.</p><p>Here are a few additional tips to increase water safety:<br><br><strong>No water wings.</strong> They might look cute, but they aren&rsquo;t effective. Instead, use a flotation vest that is Coast Guard-approved.</p><p><strong>Get wet.</strong> Be in the water with young kids who can&rsquo;t swim. <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/AAP-Gives-Updated-Advice-on-Drowning-Prevention.aspx\">The American Academy of Pediatrics&nbsp;</a>recommends &ldquo;touch supervision,&rdquo; where your hands are on the child at all times.</p><p><strong>Just keep swimming.</strong> Summer isn&rsquo;t the only time for kids&rsquo; swim lessons. Consider year-round lessons to keep swimming skills sharp.</p><p><strong>Know CPR.</strong> Parents, caregivers and pool owners should be trained in CPR.</p><p>Find more tips about child water safety <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/water-safety\">here.</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Have you ever stood in the sunscreen aisle and been overwhelmed by the number of choices for sale? Which will give you the best protection from the sun while you enjoy your summer day outdoors? Which is safest for your kids?</p><p>Each year, Consumer Reports puts the entire sunscreen aisle to the test, comparing and ranking every product with an SPF of 30 or more and claims to be water-resistant for 40 to 80 minutes.</p><p>&ldquo;The incidence of melanoma is higher the closer you live to the equator,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/surgical-oncologist/dr-christopher-pezzi-md\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Pezzi, MD, FACS,</a> surgical oncologist at Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center. &ldquo;Rates are significantly higher in Florida, Texas and Arizona than in the northern U.S. This is due to increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It&rsquo;s crucial for us to use sun protection that is effective.&rdquo;</p><p>Each product received a score between 0 and 100 at the end of the experiment, and only those in the 81-and-up range earn a coveted Consumer Reports recommendation. These five products are water-resistant for the times they claim, have an accurate SPF listed on their packaging, and all use chemical active ingredients rather than mineral.</p><p><strong>1. La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Melt-In Sunscreen Milk, SPF 60</strong></p><p>$36, or $7.20 an ounce<br>Score of 100</p><p>This lotion topped the Consumer Reports list for the third year running and remains their No. 1 choice for sun protection.</p><p><strong>2. Trader Joe&rsquo;s Spray, SPF 50+</strong></p><p>$6, or $1 an ounce<br>Score of 100</p><p>Trader Joe&#39;s sunscreen is the only other product to score a perfect 100, but is more affordable than the La Roche-Posay lotion.</p><p><strong>3. Equate Sport Lotion, SPF 50</strong></p><p>$5, or 63 cents an ounce<br>Score of 99</p><p>Quality sun protection doesn&rsquo;t have to be costly or hard to find. Equate is sold in all Walmart stores, so it should be available just about anywhere.</p><p><strong>4. BullFrog Land Sport Quik Gel, SPF 50</strong></p><p>$8.50, or $1.70 cents an ounce<br>Score of 95</p><p>This is a quick-drying formula that lasts up to 80 minutes through heavy sweating. As a bonus, it applies and dries completely clear.</p><p><strong>5. Up &amp; Up Stick Sunscreen, SPF 55</strong></p><p>$8, or $6.67 an ounce<br>Score of 85</p><p>This sunscreen from Target&#39;s in-house brand was the only stick to score above 81 and earn a recommendation from Consumer Reports.</p><p><strong>More findings</strong></p><p>Even if you&rsquo;re not breaking up with your favorite sunscreen in favor of one of Consumer Reports&rsquo; recommendations, consider their other findings as guidelines when shopping for sun protection to ensure you&rsquo;re getting the sun protection you need.</p><p>&ldquo;Skin cancer is the most common cancer type in the U.S.,&rdquo; said Dr. Pezzi. &ldquo;While many cancer rates are declining, the annual incidence of melanoma continues to rise about 3.1 percent every year. At least half of children and adolescents report one or more sunburns per year &mdash; having five or more blistering sunburns while young increases the risk of melanoma by 80 percent.&rdquo;</p><p>Over years of testing, Consumer Reports has found that mineral sunscreens containing titanium dioxide or zinc oxide as active ingredients don&rsquo;t perform as well as those with chemical active ingredients, such as avobenzone or oxybenzone. No mineral sunscreens scored well enough to make their list of recommendations this year, so consider choosing one with chemical active ingredients.</p><p>SPF, or sun protection factor, measures how long your skin will be shielded from UVA and UVB rays. Consumer Reports has discovered that many sunscreens have only half the SPF listed on their labels. Of the 73 sprays, sticks and lotions tested for the 2018 rankings, 24 tested at less than half the SPF of their label. This could mean you&rsquo;re not adequately protecting your skin, even if you think you are. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a product with an SPF of 30 or higher, so it&rsquo;s best to purchase higher SPF than you think you need.</p><p>Consumer Reports also suggests shaking sunscreen before applying to evenly distribute the active ingredients throughout the sunscreen.</p><p>Next, don&rsquo;t be shy with your application. For lotions, think of a teaspoon per area of the body to ensure you&rsquo;re getting adequate protection &mdash; one teaspoon for your face and neck, one for each arm, one for your back and so on. For sprays, apply as much as can be rubbed in and then repeat.</p><p>Whether you opt for lotion or spray, reapply every two hours and immediately after swimming or sweating.</p><p>And of course, always apply sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes before you go outside. There&rsquo;s no place like Florida in the summer, but be sure to enjoy your days in the sun safely.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Consumer Reports:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/products/sunscreen/ratings-overview/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>consumerreports.org/products/sunscreen/ratings-overview</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>No. 2 pencils: check. Composition book: check. New lunchbox: check. The beginning of the school year means stocking up on new supplies, getting vaccinations, student orientation and open houses.</p><p>The list of preparations is a little longer for children with asthma, but following it ensures they&rsquo;ll have a safe, healthy school year. Carey Smith, RRT, lead asthma educator for <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/child-advocacy\" target=\"_blank\">THE PLAYERS Center for Child Health at Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital</a>, has six tips for how parents of children with asthma can set their kids up for success this school year.</p><p><strong>1. Make sure your child&rsquo;s inhaler is ready.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Check it to ensure it&rsquo;s not expired and it still has medication in the canister. I prefer any child have a new one before going to school, but make sure it still has at least 100 inhalations,&rdquo; Smith explained.</p><p><strong>2. Meet your child&rsquo;s teacher before school starts.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Attend the school&rsquo;s open house or make an appointment before school starts to speak with the teacher,&rdquo; Smith said. &ldquo;Ask them what they know about asthma, and make sure they know the signs to look for like wheezing and coughing. If there is a school nurse on campus, speak with him or her beforehand. It makes a huge difference when you can trust who you&rsquo;re leaving your child with, and they know when to call you.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>3. Provide the teacher and the school nurse with your child&rsquo;s Asthma Action Plan.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Take your son or daughter&rsquo;s Asthma Action Plan with you. This will show the teacher and the nurse which medications they&rsquo;re taking, how often they&rsquo;re supposed to take them, and detailed steps to take in an emergency,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;The Asthma Action Plan is the best thing for a teacher or school nurse to have so they have a plan in place.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>4. Renew your child&rsquo;s Asthma Action Plan each year.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;In the Asthma Action Plan, there&rsquo;s a line on the form a doctor can sign that authorizes that child to carry an inhaler at school. Parents should complete a new one every year, or every time the child gets a new medication. We recommend giving one to the teacher and one to the school nurse. Parents should also keep a copy for themselves at home,&rdquo; Smith said.</p><p><strong>5. Take your child to get the flu shot early.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Kids with asthma are more susceptible to respiratory viruses and infections, and they tend to get sicker a lot easier,&rdquo; said Smith. She reminded parents there have been flu vaccine shortages in the past few years and advised taking your child to the pediatrician&rsquo;s office early to ensure they can receive the shot before school starts.</p><p>Of course, getting vaccinated only protects against the flu, but other illnesses can be prevented if you remind your child to wash his hands regularly to stay well year-round.</p><p><strong>6. Talk to your child about how to get help in an emergency.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes adults find children with asthma in the bathroom because they&rsquo;re having an attack and they get embarrassed. By the time someone finds them, they&rsquo;re really sick. Talk to your kids about telling their teacher or another adult when something is wrong,&rdquo; said Smith.</p><p>You can print a free Asthma Action Plan for your child at the <a href=\"http://www.communityasthmajax.org/kids-families/asthma-at-home/asthma-action-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">Community Asthma Partnership at Wolfson website</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital is one of four Asthma-Friendly Hospitals in the state, designated by The Florida Asthma Coalition. The Asthma-Friendly Hospital designation is awarded to hospitals that excel in asthma management, reducing health risks for asthma patients and preventing and minimizing asthma-related ER visits and hospitalizations.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>With fall now well underway, cold and flu season is in full effect. Young children are more susceptible to the sniffles, sharing germs at preschool or the playground with the pass of a ball or high-five. Even with the best germ prevention and hand-washing practices, your child is bound to become ill.</p><p>When your child starts to show symptoms, it can be difficult to tell what exactly is causing their plight: is this just a common cold, do they have the flu, or is it strep? Should I treat the symptoms at home, or should I call the pediatrician for an appointment? They have a fever: should they stay home from a playdate, daycare, preschool or the park?</p><p>Even though all parents worry every time one of their children gets a virus or infection, it is not all bad news. According to <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatrician/dr-tracy-tyson-md\" target=\"_blank\">Tracy Tyson, MD</a>, a pediatrician with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/orange-park-pediatrics\" target=\"_blank\">Orange Park Pediatrics</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually a good thing because kids need these viruses to build up the immune system. We all will get these viruses eventually, and they are much easier to tolerate as a child.&rdquo;</p><p>Experts with <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.com\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a> shared with us some key pieces of information to keep in mind as we navigate the school year.</p><p><strong>How do you keep germs at bay?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://bhwebapps.bmcjax.com/wolfsonfap/profile.aspx?id=2913\">Mark Bedard, DO</a>, with Orange Park Pediatrics said, &ldquo;Germs are everywhere. Unless we live in a bubble, we cannot avoid them altogether. But you can avoid spreading germs to others.&rdquo;</p><p>Some ways to avoid spreading germs to others include:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Letting others know when you or your child is sick. Don&rsquo;t pretend everyone&rsquo;s well since that could cause those around you to not take proper precautions to avoid your germs.</li><li>Children need to learn how to sneeze and cough into their elbow or at least cover their mouths. Most respiratory bugs spread quite easily when airborne, while other germs like to rest on surfaces and can live there for up to 24 hours.</li><li>Clean and disinfect all surfaces regularly.</li><li>Wash your hands! Hand sanitizer is great and simple, but nothing beats washing with soap and water.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What can you do to strengthen your child&#39;s immune system?</strong></p><p>When you send your kids to preschool or daycare, exposure to germs and viruses is unavoidable. But, don&rsquo;t let this deter you from allowing your child to experience the world around them. Dr. Bedard explained, &ldquo;Exposure to germs is actually the best way to build an immune system &ndash; hence, the idea behind immunizations. There are numerous other theories that sound good, but little evidence to support them currently.&rdquo; Healthy living, along with immunizations, can keep bodies fighting strong.</p><p><strong>W</strong><strong>hat&rsquo;s the difference between a viral infection and a bacterial infection? And, how can we treat them?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://bhwebapps.bmcjax.com/WolfsonFAP/profile.aspx?id=1139\">Mark Toney, MD</a>, a pediatric hospitalist at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, explained, &ldquo;Infections are caused when different pathogens enter the body. The two most common types of pathogens are viruses and bacteria. Viruses are microscopic agents that live and replicate inside a human cell. Bacteria are single-celled organisms that unlike human cells have a cell wall.&rdquo;</p><p>To keep in simple, just remember that a cold and the flu are viruses, and illnesses like a strep and whooping cough are bacterial infections.</p><p>What does that mean? &ldquo;Treating a viral infection versus a bacterial infection is very different,&rdquo; explained Dr. Toney. &ldquo;Most viral infections are cared for with over-the-counter medication, while bacterial infections are treated primarily with antibiotics to target the bacteria and either kill it or keep it from replicating.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Can you feel the temperature rising?</strong></p><p>For some, with a cold or other infection comes a fever. Many preschools and daycare centers have a strict rule that the child must be fever-free for 24 hours without the use of over-the-counter medicine before returning to school.</p><p>Why? &ldquo;A fever is typically the easiest way to know if you or your child is sick,&rdquo; said Dr. Bedard. &ldquo;It is an obvious symptom that does not require the child to be verbal, it is not vague, and it is measurable via a thermometer at home. This helps parents to know when to keep their children home to help prevent the spread of germs.&rdquo;</p><p>When should you take your child to the pediatrician or the emergency room? Or should you stay home?</p><p>You have determined your child is sick&mdash;he has a fever and just is not acting like himself. Will the over-the-counter remedy be enough? Or is it a bacterial infection, like strep, that requires an antibiotic for treatment?</p><p><a href=\"http://bhwebapps.bmcjax.com/WolfsonFAP/profile.aspx?id=880\">Anthony Pohlgeers, MD</a>, a pediatric emergency medicine physician with the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/emergency\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Emergency Centers</a>, encouraged, &ldquo;Trust your gut. Your pediatrician can help diagnose your child as well as provide treatment recommendations. But, ultimately, if you think it&rsquo;s an emergency, don&rsquo;t hesitate, and just call 911. You know your child best.&rdquo;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>You might not realize it, but your car can be one of the most dangerous places for your child. According to Safe Kids Worldwide, more than 3,000 children in the United States died in motor vehicle accidents in 2012 alone.</p><p>And while the number of motor vehicle fatalities in children under the age of 13 has decreased since 1975, the Centers for Disease Control say car accidents accounted for 38 percent of all unintentional deaths in kids age 1 to 13 in 2015.</p><p>The numbers might be troubling, but you&rsquo;re not helpless to prevent the same fate from befalling your child. Correctly securing your child not just in the backseat, but in the correct type of seat, ensures he or she will be safe during your next car ride.</p><p><strong>Finding the right fit</strong></p><p>Most parents know their kids should ride in the back seat, but there&rsquo;s much more to child passenger safety than that. You should always make sure you have the right kind of seat to suit your child&rsquo;s age, weight, height and other factors.</p><p>Ages &lt;1-2: From birth to age 2, your child should ride in a rear-facing seat. This is the safest position for your new little one, and oftentimes can continue to be even after they turn 2; it&rsquo;s recommended that your child is in a rear-facing seat until they can no longer physically fit in one.</p><p>Ages 4-7: Once your child graduates from rear-facing, they&rsquo;re ready for the traditional front-facing car seat.</p><p>Ages 8-12: After your kid outgrows his front-facing car seat, it&rsquo;s time for a booster seat. Booster seats do exactly what the name implies: they boost your child up so the back seat&rsquo;s seat belt can fit. Note that the lap belt should fit snugly across the upper thighs while the shoulder belt should lie snugly across the shoulder and chest.</p><p>Eventually, your child will outgrow the booster seat as well. However, it&rsquo;s important that they continue to ride in the backseat with the standard seat belt until age 13.</p><p><strong>More than clicking a few buckles</strong></p><p>Okay, so you&rsquo;ve done your research and got the perfect seat for your child&rsquo;s age, weight and height. It&rsquo;s comfortable, the buckles are snug and secure, and you&rsquo;re confident your kid will be safe the next time you&rsquo;re on the road.</p><p>Well, unfortunately, you probably installed it incorrectly. You&rsquo;re not alone, though.</p><p>&ldquo;Roughly 80 percent of all car seats are installed incorrectly,&rdquo; said Cynthia Dennis, RN, coordinator of Safe Kids Northeast Florida, led by T<a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/child-advocacy\" target=\"_blank\">HE PLAYERS Center for Child Health at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>. &ldquo;Although, in our personal experience, it seems closer to 90 percent.&rdquo;</p><p>Dennis and the rest of the team at Safe Kids Northeast Florida operate regular car seat inspection stations where parents can make an appointment to have their car seat installations vetted by Safe Kids-certified experts.</p><p>A typical visit to the inspection station starts with the current car seat being run through a gauntlet of examinations to ensure it&rsquo;s appropriate for its rider&rsquo;s age, size and weight. If the seat is sized correctly and is in good condition &ndash; believe it or not, car seats have an expiration date as the plastic that makes up the seat can get brittle and break in old age &ndash; then it passes inspection.</p><p>Next, the inspector guides the parent through the correct installation process. Each inspector has been certified through Safe Kids&rsquo; three-day learning course, so they&rsquo;re sure to catch even the smallest of errors a parent might make during installation.</p><p>After the inspection, parents can drive away knowing their children are safer in the car than when they arrived. Which, as Dennis put it, is the entire idea behind Child Passenger Safety Week.</p><p>&ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s helping parents find the right car seat for their child or teaching them the correct way to install the seat, our goal is always the same,&rdquo; Dennis said. &ldquo;We just want your child to be as safe as possible at all times on the road.&rdquo;</p><p>Visit <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/car-safety\" target=\"_blank\">Safe Kids online</a> to learn more about child passenger safety or to find a car seat inspection station near you.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>There is no escaping it; we live in a digital era with new technology coming out every day. While today&rsquo;s tech-savvy parent might have the latest and greatest device loaded with apps, how and when should our children be allowed access to the same technology? Are all screens and content created equal? Let&rsquo;s turn to the experts to find out.</p><p>We asked <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-michelle-mcdonald-phd\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle McDonald, PhD</a>, a child psychologist with the W<a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/behavioral-health/outpatient\" target=\"_blank\">olfson Children&#39;s Center for Behavioral Health</a>, how much TV is too much TV? She reported, &quot;Infants learn best through physical exploration of their environment and interaction with their caregivers.&quot; In addition, babies are not able to process or understand the complex shapes, sounds, and symbols projected on a screen. &quot;For these young children,&quot; Dr. McDonald said, &quot;television exposure has little to no benefit. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no intentional television watching for this age group and I find that recommendation well-founded.&quot;</p><p>Once your infant enters toddlerhood, they are more likely to benefit from all that the screen has to offer. Still, according to Dr. McDonald, &quot;The best learning occurs when information is supported and reinforced by a caregiver. The parent or caregiver should sit with the child and help him understand and interpret what he is seeing.&quot; <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatrician/dr-mark-bedard-do\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Bedard, DO</a>, a pediatrician with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/orange-park-pediatrics\" target=\"_blank\">Orange Park Pediatrics in Argyle Forest</a>, agreed, adding, &quot;Toddlers, or children younger than the age of five, should be limited to no more than one hour of screen time a day.&quot;</p><p>Luckily, parents have several options for top quality, developmentally appropriate media for their little ones. There are apps and television programs that support vocabulary development, social skills, and emotional education, which are among a few of the benefits. But Dr. Bedard clarified, &quot;Screen time should be a family- or adult-supervised event. I would recommend the parent watching and interacting with the child to enhance the learning the child gets out of the show.&quot;</p><p>When it comes to apps and television programs, the experts agree: no screen time for infants, and no more than one hour of high-quality programs or games for children five and under. &quot;As doctors, we look at screen time as a whole,&quot; said Dr. Bedard. &quot;That includes tablets, iPhones, television, computers, video games, etc.&quot; Does that mean we need to ignore FaceTime calls from Grandma or Skype calls while Mom or Dad is away on business?<br><br>&quot;Video chatting with relatives is a great way to stay connected!&quot; Dr. McDonald explained, &quot;Not only does it encourage bonding with loved-ones who might not be available in the child&#39;s daily life, but it can also expose children to new vocabulary and promotes the use of modern technology.&quot; However, just as with the use of apps or games or television, video chatting is best when supervised by an adult caregiver.</p><p>Remember, screen time should be kept on the sidelines through infancy, and remain a group sport with your toddlers and preschoolers. Video chatting is a great way for kids to have supervised interactions with loved ones.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Babies spend a lot of time on their backs every night while sleeping, so it&rsquo;s important to ensure they get adequate time on their tummy during the day. Tummy time is a critical component to your baby&rsquo;s development as it helps strengthen muscles, improves coordination and even engages their brain.</p><p>It&rsquo;s natural to lay your baby on his or her back. Your baby is comfortable and it&rsquo;s the safest position in most scenarios, especially while sleeping. On their backs, babies are at lower risk for suffocation, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and other sleep-related deaths.</p><p>But if your baby spends too much time on their back, they can develop flat spots on their head, known as plagiocephaly. Lying in the same position can also lead to some neck muscles being less developed than others. Both these problems require specific headgear or other methods of correction.</p><p>However, laying your baby on his or her belly for a few minutes at a time is the perfect way to prevent these issues from ever happening. That&rsquo;s not all tummy time does for your baby, though.</p><p>&ldquo;Tummy time strengthens so much of your baby&rsquo;s upper body because it essentially teaches them how to support themselves,&rdquo; said Paul Cornelissens, a pediatric physical therapist with <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/rehabilitation\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Rehabilitation Services</a>. &ldquo;It allows the baby&rsquo;s arms, shoulders, and neck to develop in a symmetrical fashion instead of unevenly.&rdquo;</p><p><span style='font-family: \"Fauna One\", serif; font-size: 1.125em; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; background-color: initial; text-align: initial;'>While on his belly, your baby will prop himself up on his elbows, flexing muscles in his arms and shoulders that haven&rsquo;t been used much before. His world will look new to him from this angle, so he&rsquo;ll start to crane his neck and look around. This helps develop head control and strengthen neck muscles.</span></p><p>&ldquo;Tummy time is great for building strength in the neck and arms,&rdquo; said Cynthia Dennis, RN, coordinator of Safe Kids Northeast Florida, led by T<a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/about/child-advocacy\" target=\"_blank\">HE PLAYERS Center for Child Health at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>. &ldquo;It also encourages more exploration of their environment, which engages and helps develop their brain and eyes.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>What if my baby hates tummy time?</strong></p><p>Many babies go along with tummy time, but some babies won&rsquo;t be thrilled the first time they&rsquo;re placed on their belly. Remember, though, that it&rsquo;s a brand new position for them and that can be scary.</p><p>&ldquo;Your baby might start crying when you first put them down for tummy time,&rdquo; said Dennis. &ldquo;Start with short, three to five minutes sessions to make it easier on you and your baby. Eventually you can start increasing it to 10 or 15 minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>There are plenty of ways to distract your baby during tummy time to make it more enjoyable for your little one. Talking, reading a book, or singing to your baby during tummy time not only engages their brain, but it also strengthens the bond between baby and parent.</p><p>Just remember: Even if your baby loudly disapproves of tummy time, it&rsquo;s a critical step on the path to healthy development. Once they&rsquo;re scooting around the floor on their own, you&rsquo;ll know all the crying was worth it. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>7 reasons tummy time matters</strong></p><ol><li>Strengthens back, leg, hip, arm and neck muscles</li><li>Develops upper body strength and head control</li><li>Prepares baby for sitting, scooting and crawling</li><li>Can prevent flat-head syndrome</li><li>Aids fine motor skills in hands</li><li>Helps gas and constipation</li><li>Good for brain and eye development</li></ol>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Any mom can attest to the fact that taking care of their children is such a frenzied task that your own self-care became an afterthought.</p><p>There is no better time than now to bring focus to your well-being and recommit to wellness goals you might have set earlier in the year. It&rsquo;s never too late to commit to a healthy lifestyle.</p><p><strong>Stick to the plan</strong></p><p>The kids are occupied in school or camp, and you&rsquo;re ready to shed some pounds or just feel healthier. But after a couple months of infrequent exercise, where do you start?</p><p>&ldquo;The most important thing when starting a journey to get into better shape is planning ahead and staying organized,&rdquo; said Diana Rosito, a wellness coach at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/y-healthy-living-centers/northside-dunn-ave\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist North Y Healthy Living Center</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so important to have a plan because, at some point, you&rsquo;ll have to adjust to new schedules even during the school year. With a firm &ndash; yet flexible &ndash; plan in place, it&rsquo;s easier to adapt to unforeseen schedule changes.&rdquo;</p><p>Prior to her work as a wellness coach with Baptist Health, Rosito studied health education, nutrition and dietetics. But, perhaps more importantly, she has personal experience with this topic: she&rsquo;s a mother to a two-year-old.</p><p>&ldquo;Finding a plan that works for you and sticking to it creates consistency, which helps you stay on track even when things get hectic,&rdquo; Rosito said. &ldquo;I had to learn that for myself. I can&rsquo;t work out in the evening because I&rsquo;m ready to be home with my husband and little one. So getting up a little early and squeezing in a workout helps create the consistency I need.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, your schedule can be as regimented as boot camp, but it means nothing if you&rsquo;re struggling to find the willpower to exercise. That&rsquo;s where a gym partner comes in handy.</p><p>&ldquo;Find a workout buddy, someone who can go to the gym with you. Or even just someone you can go walking with in the evening,&rdquo; Rosito explained. &ldquo;It creates accountability and even gives you someone to talk to.&rdquo;</p><p>If the gym isn&rsquo;t your thing or it doesn&rsquo;t fit into your schedule, don&rsquo;t give up! There are countless workout plans available online that can get your blood pumping at home. Even as little as five to 10 minutes of exercise every day goes a long way towards reaching your goals.</p><p><strong>You are what you eat</strong></p><p>Routine exercise is only one piece of the fitness puzzle. Pair your vigorous workouts with a healthy and nutritious meal plan to start melting pounds.</p><p>&ldquo;For moms wanting to get back into shape, nutrition and physical activity go hand-in-hand,&rdquo; Rosito explained. &ldquo;Weekly meal prep is also an option that gives you more time during the week you&rsquo;d otherwise spend cooking. Take in a lot of healthy proteins, whole grains like those found in brown rice, and fruits and vegetables. Drink a lot of water so you stay hydrated.&rdquo;</p><p>Energy is fleeting enough as it is for moms. Eating the right foods and drinking lots of water gives your body the fuel it needs to recover not just from a tough workout, but from the rigorous demands of being a mother.</p><p>Rosito notes that it&rsquo;s also important to not be too strict, either. A weight loss plan without a little room for fun and flexibility is one that&rsquo;s destined to fail.</p><p>Above all else, whether you&rsquo;re a new mom with a newborn who isn&rsquo;t quite ready for school or a seasoned veteran who&rsquo;s mastered the family time/school year balance, keep your goals realistic. Stressing yourself out over lofty fitness goals only ensures that you&rsquo;re less likely to attain them.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m such a firm believer that anything is possible. If you have a goal you want to reach, it&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; Rosito said. &ldquo;No matter how hectic things get, no matter how many kids you have, you can always make it work.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Find freebies!</strong></p><p>A good way to help yourself stick with your plan is to find a wellness coach. Here&rsquo;s how to take advantage of free wellness coaching:</p><p>There are five Baptist Y Healthy Living Centers throughout Jacksonville, located within a local YMCA (see list below). The Baptist Y Healthy Living Centers are a partnership between Baptist Health and YMCA of Florida&rsquo;s First Coast to provide free health screenings and health programs to all in the community. You don&rsquo;t have to be a YMCA member to have a free health screening or participate in programs.</p><p>You can schedule an appointment with a wellness coach to determine your baseline health including blood pressure, glucose, lipid panel and body composition analysis. You also get free wellness coaching.

Scott&rsquo;s mother, Nancy, majored in piano at Converse.</p><p>&ldquo;My sister, who is now a nurse, played the harp.

Whenever the mood struck her, the pink-pajama-clad Scott leaned the elegant wooden instrument against her right shoulder and played as if she had been transported to a heavenly realm.</p><p><strong>A special visitor stops by&nbsp;</strong></p><p>During a recent hospital stay, Scott gave an impromptu performance for a roomful of visitors, including Jacksonville Jaguars Executive Vice President Tom Coughlin and his wife, Judy, who created the Jay Fund in 1996 to help families battling childhood cancer.</p><p>At the time, Scott was on the fourth day of her third round of chemo in less than three months. Still, she was able to muster the strength to play a 90-second piece in the key of C.

The nameplate also includes a sketch of a golden harp.</p><p>While undergoing chemo, Scott, who plans to take online classes in music history and theory next fall through Converse College, didn&rsquo;t always feel like practicing, but just knowing the harp was close by was a comfort.</p><p>&ldquo;Even with all of my health issues, I can still get up and go over to the harp and play something and not only will I enjoy it, but the people around me will enjoy it,&rdquo; Scott said after playing Carlos Salzedo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Song in the Night,&rdquo; one of her favorite tunes because it shows off some of the more unusual sound effects of the harp.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Music is something I can always hold on to.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>In Patti Seagraves&rsquo; nearly four years as a family medicine physician assistant (PA-C) in the greater Tallahassee area, she has seen and treated almost every health condition &mdash; from sinus infections and ankle sprains to diabetes and heart disease.</p><p>But things look very different from the perspective of a new mom, even one with medical training.</p><p>Patti had a picture-perfect pregnancy right up until she began to develop symptoms of preeclampsia, a potentially life-threatening complication that causes high blood pressure and can affect the kidneys and other organs. At 34 weeks, Patti&rsquo;s obstetrician made the decision to deliver the baby via cesarean section as her condition began to worsen and the risk to mom and baby grew.</p><p>Patti gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Piper Lauren, in September. Because Piper was born early, she required a two-week neonatal intensive care unit stay at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare (TMH), but appeared perfectly healthy.</p><p>When Piper was nearly six weeks old, Patti began to see changes in her baby.</p><p>&ldquo;I noticed Piper&rsquo;s feeding was taking longer and she wasn&rsquo;t taking in as much,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s a baby, and babies change their schedules. My husband and I weren&rsquo;t too concerned at first.&rdquo;</p><p>Their concern grew when Piper&rsquo;s feeding issues continued, and she spit up a lot when she did eat. &ldquo;She was breathing pretty fast and sleeping a lot more,&rdquo; Patti said. &ldquo;We knew something wasn&rsquo;t right.&rdquo;</p><p>The new parents had a baby monitor that included a device to track an infant&#39;s heart rate and oxygen levels. &ldquo;Piper&rsquo;s oxygen saturation levels were in the high 80s and low 90s at the time,&rdquo; Patti said. &ldquo;I knew that wasn&rsquo;t good, and I told my husband we needed to take her to the ER.&rdquo;</p><p>Doctors at TMH ordered a chest X-ray and bloodwork. &nbsp;But when Piper&rsquo;s condition continued to worsen, they called in Thomas Truman, MD, pediatric critical care physician at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, who arrived at 3 am that day. Piper&rsquo;s oxygen saturation levels were now down to the low 80s and she wasn&rsquo;t resting and was struggling to breathe.</p><p>&ldquo;Most babies at this age with breathing troubles are suffering from either a viral or bacterial respiratory illness that irritates the airways or lungs,&rdquo; said Dr. Truman. &ldquo;When Piper didn&rsquo;t respond well to respiratory support, I explained to her parents that I was concerned it was potentially a problem with her heart and asked Dr. Vining to evaluate her.&rdquo;</p><p>Mac Vining, MD, a pediatric cardiologist with <a href=\"https://www.tmh.org/services/children/wolfson-childrens-specialty-center-at-tallahassee-memorial-healthcare\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare</a>, was called in. It wasn&rsquo;t the first time Dr. Vining and Patti had met: she and her colleagues at Tallahassee Primary Care Associates (TPCA) had attended several of Dr. Vining&rsquo;s continuing medical education events and the two had established a close professional relationship.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize it was Patti until I walked in the room,&rdquo; Dr. Vining said. &ldquo;When I was briefed on Piper&rsquo;s symptoms that morning, I was initially very concerned she had a congenital heart defect. In babies that age, an inability to feed is one of the most concerning issues related to congenital heart disease because feeding is how babies use most of their energy.&rdquo;</p><p>Congenital heart disease is the most common birth defect, affecting nearly 1 in 100 newborns in the U.S.</p><p>To determine if his diagnosis was correct, Dr. Vining performed an echocardiogram, a sonogram of the heart&rsquo;s chambers, valves, walls and the blood vessels. The echocardiogram showed Piper&rsquo;s heart was enlarged and she also had a bicuspid aortic valve that was severely narrowed, impacting her body&rsquo;s ability to regulate blood flow from the heart into the aorta.</p><p><strong>A Tallahassee-Jacksonville connection</strong></p><p>Concerned the baby was so young and in such distress, Dr. Vining knew time was of the essence.</p><p>He reached out to his colleagues in Jacksonville, pediatric cardiologists Robert English, MD, and Brandon Kuebler, MD, with the UF Health Pediatric Cardiovascular Center affiliated with <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>. The three children&rsquo;s heart specialists were in agreement, and Dr. Kuebler immediately arranged for the baby to be transferred to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s via the Kids Kare Mobile ICU.</p><p>Piper arrived in Jacksonville that afternoon, with an expert cardiac team standing by. Dr. English remembered: &ldquo;Piper was in critical condition with severe aortic valve stenosis, meaning her heart could not push blood through the aortic valve to get to the body. Her heart was failing, and she needed immediate treatment.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Kuebler performed an echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis before sending Piper to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab, where Dr. English performed an interventional procedure to dilate the baby&rsquo;s narrowed aortic valve.</p><p>&ldquo;One of Piper&rsquo;s cardiac nurses, whose name is also Patty, was with us from the Cath Lab to the Cardiovascular ICU (CVICU),&rdquo; Patti remembered. &ldquo;She called us when the procedure started, part-way through and when it was finished.</p><p>&ldquo;Then Patty took us down to the Cath Lab so Dr. English could show us pictures of our baby&rsquo;s heart and tell us how she was doing,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Since I&rsquo;m a PA, I wanted to understand what Piper&rsquo;s heart looked like when he was in there and what he found. Right after the procedure, Piper&rsquo;s oxygen levels returned to normal. And all of this took place within 12 hours from diagnosis in Tallahassee to treatment in Jacksonville!&rdquo;</p><p>After a short stay in the CVICU at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, Piper was discharged, and the Seagraves family was able to return to Tallahassee, where Patti is now a stay-at-home mom.</p><p><strong>Heart care near home</strong></p><p>Fortunately, Piper is able to have her follow-up appointments with Dr. Vining at a pediatric outpatient specialty center called Wolfson Children&rsquo;s at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare. This center is the result of an affiliation agreement between the major Big Bend area health system, Northeast Florida&#39;s only children&rsquo;s hospital, and Tallahassee Primary Care Associates. &nbsp;</p><p>Although Patti never expected she or her family would need the pediatric specialty services that are part of the affiliation, she&rsquo;s relieved it was there for Piper.</p><p>&ldquo;Tallahassee is a large city, the capital of Florida, but we were lacking in some pediatric specialty services before this affiliation,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If these services weren&rsquo;t here, we would&rsquo;ve had to travel three to four hours to Jacksonville to get the outpatient care Piper needed. That&rsquo;s not easy when you have a little one. When you have specialty care in Tallahassee, you bring local families a lot of comfort, so this is a phenomenal resource.&rdquo;</p>",

After all, at the time in 2015, he was a student at the University of Florida, and sometimes the workload weighed heavy on the then- 21-year-old.</p><p>But, Ellis caved and went to the school infirmary. As it turned out, it wasn&rsquo;t any of the diagnoses he had given himself. Instead, there it sat &mdash; a mass in his chest.</p><p>Ellis would soon discover he had stage III Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer that starts in the lymphatic system, is generally seen in patients between the ages of 15 and 35. It can be highly curable if caught in its early stages and responds well to chemotherapy treatment.</p><p>Ellis, his family and Gabi, his girlfriend at the time, started making trips to Jacksonville for chemotherapy treatment at Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center with medical oncologist Robert Zaiden, MD &mdash; just four days after Ellis graduated from college with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in business administration.</p><p>A few days after his first session on Dec. 30, 2015, he proposed marriage to Gabi.

Bugs?&rdquo; you ask. &ldquo;Who wants to spend summer worried about bites and stings?&rdquo;</p><p>The hot, humid temps are great for backyard picnics and outdoor activities, but they are also the perfect conditions for black-legged ticks. These creatures, carriers of Lyme disease, are more prevalent in the summer than any other time of the year.</p><p>According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cases of tick-borne diseases more than doubled from 2004 to 2016 &ndash; &nbsp;from 22,000 to 48,000 cases &ndash; with Lyme disease accounting for 82 percent of them. Worst of all, due to under-reporting, the numbers are actually expected to be much higher &mdash; trending closer to 350,000 in 2016.</p><p>The majority of cases were reported in northern states like Maine, Delaware, New Jersey and Vermont. The CDC, however, says there&rsquo;s one small hitch: occasionally diseases can be reported in a state where it was not acquired.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-brian-granger-do\">Brian Granger, DO, a Baptist Primary Care family physician,</a> checks his patients for Lyme disease any time an individual shows symptoms of fatigue, tingling or numbness of extremities.</p><div class=\"u-size1of3 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1528378612/Juice/lyme_disease_second_image.jpg\" alt=\"A circular rash associated with lyme disease\"></div><p>One of the most obvious signs of Lyme disease is the circular rash, he said &mdash; almost like a halo around the tick bite. However, that doesn&rsquo;t have to be present for someone to be infected with the bacterium that causes Lyme.</p><p>Untreated Lyme disease can include a variety of complications, such as encephalitis, a brain infection; myocarditis, a heart infection; or endocarditis, a heart valve infection. People can also develop chronic fatigue syndrome, a disorder that causes extreme tiredness that doesn&rsquo;t go away with rest, Dr. Granger said.</p><p>Can these consequences be long term? &nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, yes, they can.</p><p>But here&rsquo;s the good news: The risk of acquiring a tick-borne infection is still actually pretty low. Ticks transmit bacteria only after they have attached and taken a meal from their new host. The deer tick that usually carries the Lyme bacterium typically feeds for up to 36 hours before transmission, placing the risk of Lyme disease around 2 percent.</p><p>To reduce your risk of a bite, Dr. Granger recommends wearing long pants and sleeves when venturing into the woods.</p><p>&ldquo;Make sure your clothes are white or khaki so you can easily spot ticks and then frequently check for them on your clothing and on your skin,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;If you are bitten by a tick, you should contact your doctor and get tested, even if you don&rsquo;t have a rash.&rdquo;</p><p>If you get diagnosed with Lyme disease, the standard of care recommended by the CDC is 10 to 21 days of doxycycline, an oral antibiotic. Dr. Granger says after those two to three weeks, he would want to see the patient again to verify the Lyme disease is gone.</p><p>&ldquo;There is still some debate about treatment and how long Lyme disease can last in individuals,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just make sure to be aware of how you feel and communicate that with your doctor. If you&rsquo;re going to google about Lyme disease, make sure you are checking a reputable source.&rdquo;</p><p>Source:<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html\">&nbsp; Centers for Disease Control</a></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Did you know caregivers are more at-risk for stress-related illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, heart disease and stroke? Ignoring their own needs, many caregivers are so focused on caring for an older loved one that they put themselves last.</p><p>&ldquo;I tell caregivers &lsquo;Go along to get along,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Lynda Gridley, a speech-language pathologist at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/agewell-center-for-senior-health\">Baptist AgeWell Center for Senior Health</a> who provides strategies for caring for loved ones with cognitive issues like dementia. &ldquo;Resist the urge to challenge what they are saying and that will help relieve frustration.&rdquo;</p><p>Here are some more tips to become a stronger and healthier caregiver.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Let go of the guilt.</strong> Caregivers often feel guilty when they take time for themselves, but you can&rsquo;t care for an older loved one if you are neglecting your own care. Find a healthy activity you love &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s going for a walk, reading, working on a project or gardening, and promise yourself you will take 30 minutes each day for an activity that brings you joy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Try to get more sleep.</strong> Even if it&rsquo;s just 15 or 30 minutes a night, try to get more rest. Exhaustion wreaks havoc with your emotions, so if you aren&rsquo;t getting enough sleep, you are setting yourself up for frustration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t argue.&nbsp;</strong>Especially in situations where there are memory issues, don&rsquo;t try to argue your point even if the person you are caring for is wrong. Instead, try to refocus the person on something else by changing the subject.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t take things personally.</strong> This bit of advice actually works in many areas of life, not just with caregiving. People you are caring for may lash out in frustration, but try to remember they are not angry with you, but with their situation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keep things in perspective.</strong> When you are in the midst of caregiving, it may seem like it will never end, but of course, there will come a time when it will. Keep the big picture in mind.</p></li></ol>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Just like fashion, fad diets come and go. In the &lsquo;60s, it was the cabbage diet, promising you could lose 10 pounds in seven days by eating as much cabbage soup as you&rsquo;d like (no, thank you!). Then came the Scarsdale Diet, the Hollywood Diet&reg;, the Cookie Diet, The South Beach Diet, the No-Sugar Diet, the Paleo Diet&reg;, the Keto Diet, and the list goes on.</p><p>&ldquo;All of these diets have healthy elements, but they usually lack the full range of vitamins and nutrients your body needs,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-patricia-calhoun-md\">Patricia McFall Calhoun, MD,</a> a family physician with Baptist Primary Care. &ldquo;Many restrict you to only a few foods, so it&rsquo;s hard to stick to these diets long term. Most people get tired of eating the same thing over and over again.&rdquo;</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a look at the pros and cons of some of today&rsquo;s most popular diets:</p><ul><li><strong>Juice Cleanse</strong> &ndash; Called &ldquo;juicing,&rdquo; this diet is a great way to reach your daily fruit and veggie quota. Unfortunately, you don&rsquo;t get the fiber that comes from eating fresh fruits and vegetables because the juicer extracts the juice and leaves the pulp (containing fiber) behind. Fiber helps you feel full, so it&rsquo;s common to feel hungry when juice cleansing. You don&rsquo;t get the protein you need either, which could cause you to lose muscle mass. Combine all of that with the fact that fruit can have a lot of calories, and you might want to rethink pulling that blender out of storage.</li><li><strong>Keto</strong> &ndash; This diet, along with most low-carb diets, causes your body to go into a state of ketosis, which happens when your body doesn&rsquo;t get enough carbohydrates. Because your cells don&rsquo;t have enough carbs to burn for energy, your body burns fat instead, creating ketones which can also be used for energy. Some people say the high-protein, high-fat diet makes them feel fuller. Something to consider: if you have diabetes, this diet can be dangerous.</li><li><strong>Paleo</strong> &ndash; Think caveman. Pretty much anything our ancient hunter-gatherer ancestors ate. Grass-fed, lean meats and fish, fruits, vegetables and healthy fats like nuts and avocados are the mainstays. Grains, dairy, processed foods and sugar are out, but occasional alcohol, as long as it&rsquo;s not grain-based like beer, is OK. While most people report losing weight on this diet, it can be expensive due to the limited food choices and the absence of processed and packaged food.</li><li><strong>Whole 30</strong> &ndash; For 30 days, you eat three &ldquo;clean&rdquo; meals a day. You can&rsquo;t have processed foods, sugar, alcohol, grains, legumes or dairy. On the good list are meat, poultry, fish, veggies, fruits and fats. The upside of the diet is that you will likely lose weight; the downside is that by sacrificing dairy and whole grains, you are reducing consumption of important nutrients such as fiber, vitamin E, iron, folate and calcium for a month.</li></ul><p>Still, Dr. Calhoun doesn&rsquo;t rule these types of diets out completely. &ldquo;If you are healthy and your doctor says it&rsquo;s OK, it&rsquo;s fine to try one of these diets to jump-start your weight loss, but they are very hard to sustain long-term,&rdquo; Dr. Calhoun said.</p><p>As we have heard from many experts, there is one diet that Dr. Calhoun recommends &ndash; yup, you guessed it &ndash; the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/wellness/tell-your-heart-olive-you\">Mediterranean diet,</a> which focuses on fruits, veggies, whole grains, fish, seafood, beans, nuts and legumes. Limited amounts of meat, poultry and eggs are allowed, as is red wine in moderation.</p><p>&ldquo;But you can still gain weight on the Mediterranean diet if you take in too many calories,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Portion control, regular exercise, and calorie balance are all very important.&rdquo;</p><p>Regardless of your eating plan, Dr. Calhoun&#39;s diet suggestions include staying away from packaged and processed foods and what she calls the &ldquo;wicked whites&rdquo; &ndash; rice, bread, pasta and potatoes. (Whole-grain versions of rice, bread and pasta are better options.) &ldquo;This is a good way to avoid unnecessary calories that have little nutritional value.</p><p>&ldquo;Rather than focusing on a &lsquo;diet,&rdquo; focus on a healthy lifestyle, not a quick-fix,&rdquo; said Dr. Calhoun. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a marathon, not a sprint.&rdquo;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>According to a 2016 report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), 9.5 percent of students in 8th grade use e-cigarettes. That number increases to 16.2 percent by grade 12, with seven in 10 students in this age group being exposed to e-cigarette ads from manufacturers. It&rsquo;s no wonder e-cig use is higher among underage high school students than adults.</p><p>One brand of e-cigarette is especially difficult for teachers and parents to spot &mdash; the JUUL, which looks like a flash drive and even charges using a USB port. The JUUL was released in 2015, and today it accounts for more than half of all e-cig sales in the U.S.</p><div class=\"u-size1of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Dr. Mikah Owen\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1527795850/Juice/Mikah_Owen_MD_175771.jpg\"></div><p>&ldquo;One reason is because it&rsquo;s discrete,&rdquo; said UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville pediatrician Mikah Owen, MD, MPH, medical director of <a href=\"https://www.schoolhealthjax.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s School-Based Health Centers</a> located on the Jean Ribault Senior High School campus. &ldquo;Because of how the JUUL looks, it can be difficult to get caught. And having one can be a status symbol; to young people, JUULs may make you seem cool. There is also evidence of e-cigarettes being marketed towards kids and young adults in a way that traditional tobacco products are prohibited from. Specifically, the flavoring is more geared toward kids.&rdquo;</p><p>Flavors like mango, cool cucumber and fruit medley are all available on the market. These flavors disguise some of the same dangerous chemicals hiding in traditional cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that while e-cigarette aerosol contains fewer harmful chemicals than traditional cigarettes, it&rsquo;s still full of nicotine, heavy metals and carcinogenic (cancer-causing) agents. Certain e-cigarettes have even been known to explode while charging, and the liquid used for vaping can be toxic.</p><p><strong>More e-cig dangers</strong></p><p>&ldquo;A typical cigarette contains between 10 and 30 milligrams of nicotine,&quot; explained Dr. Owen. &quot;An e-cigarette cartridge can contain between zero and 36 milligrams. The solution can be lethal to the wrong person &mdash; if it&rsquo;s ingested by a young child, it could cause a nicotine overdose. There has been at least one reported death after a child consumed the e-liquid.&rdquo;</p><p>With that much nicotine in the hands of a teenager, addiction is a serious risk associated with vaping. Nicotine exposure during adolescence not only causes addiction but can damage the brain, which continues developing until age 25.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a ton of studies on this yet, but it seems the effects of vaping would have more of an impact on the developing teen brain than an adult brain,&rdquo; said Dr. Owen. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know the exact implications of vaping as a teenager yet, but I think we will in the near future.&rdquo;</p><p>In the NIDA report, a survey found that 66 percent of teens who vape believed their e-cig only contained flavoring, and 13.7 percent didn&rsquo;t know what was in them at all. Only 13.2 percent of teen users were aware of the nicotine content.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of misinformation out there,&rdquo; explained Dr. Owen. &ldquo;People tend to think they&rsquo;re not tobacco products, but they do contain nicotine so they are addictive. They&rsquo;re not as easily regulated as traditional cigarettes because there are so many brands and concentrations.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Legislation proposed</strong></p><p>The Food and Drug Administration does not currently regulate e-cigarettes, so manufacturers are not required to report what&rsquo;s in them. In recent months, lawmakers from across the U.S. have called on the FDA to ban e-cigarette flavors that appeal to youngsters. Many also want JUUL and lookalike products to stop online sales, and ensure their products are not sold or marketing to underage users.</p><p>While legislation takes time, parents can begin educating their children today. The Surgeon General&rsquo;s website recommends setting a positive example by being tobacco-free. Parents can start a conversation about vaping by asking their teen what they think about e-cigarettes, or if they know anyone who uses e-cigs. Once Mom or Dad creates an open dialogue, they will have a better chance at hearing honest feedback from their son or daughter and talking about the risks of vaping.</p><p><em>Know the Risks: E-cigarettes &amp; Young People:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://e-cigarettes.surgeongeneral.gov/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>e-cigarettes.surgeongeneral.gov</em></a></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>One in five adults in the U.S. experiences mental illness each year, so it&rsquo;s likely you or someone you know will be affected by it in your lifetime. Unfortunately, the stigmas surrounding mental illness can keep many people from speaking up or seeking help, and make those who are diagnosed feel judged, weak or flawed.</p><p>&ldquo;I have seen adolescents who didn&rsquo;t want to go to school anymore because they were laughed at or because people didn&rsquo;t want to associate with them,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-blanche-williams-phd\" target=\"_blank\">Blanche Williams, PhD,</a> psychologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen adults afraid to try new things for similar reasons. I think the main thing stigmas do is lower their self-esteem. It&rsquo;s hard to think well of yourself if people reject you because you&rsquo;ve been given a mental health diagnosis.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>1. Labelling someone based on their condition</strong></p><p>When someone is diagnosed with a physical condition like arthritis or diabetes, it would be considered insensitive to call them an &ldquo;arthritic&rdquo; or a &ldquo;diabetic.&rdquo; &nbsp;People aren&rsquo;t defined by their diseases. However, you&rsquo;ve probably heard people calling others &ldquo;schizophrenic,&rdquo; &ldquo;depressed&rdquo; or &ldquo;bipolar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is a tendency to characterize a whole human being in terms of a diagnosis, and that&rsquo;s so unfair to a person,&rdquo; said Dr. Williams. &ldquo;Most people have some sort of medical illness every now and then and probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to be known as the diabetic. There&rsquo;s a big movement within the mental health community to get the public to stop using mental health diagnoses that way.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>2. Blaming tragedies on mental illness</strong></p><p>After a mass shooting, authorities and media outlets seem to always focus on the mental health of the perpetrator. More often than not, they do so without knowing if the person has any history of mental illness. Drawing these connections between mental health and major tragedies feeds into the myth that people with mental illness are violent, dangerous or more likely to commit crimes.</p><p>&ldquo;Then we get public discussions about mental illness that just are not accurate,&rdquo; said Dr. Williams. In reality, people who live with mental health conditions are more likely to be the victims of violent crimes rather than the perpetrators. Fewer than 5 percent of gun-related killings are committed by someone diagnosed with a mental illness, according to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/\" target=\"_blank\">a 2015 study.</a></p><p><strong>3. Using terms like depressed and OCD to describe normal feelings</strong></p><p>We all have tough days, but when we use clinical diagnoses to describe our feelings, it can minimize how difficult those conditions are for those who live with them.</p><p>&ldquo;Over the years as different diagnoses have become more well-known to the public, what these conditions really mean doesn&rsquo;t keep up with the awareness of the name,&rdquo; explained Dr. Williams.</p><p>For example, if you like things neat and tidy, describing yourself as OCD minimizes the impact obsessive- compulsive disorder can have on someone&rsquo;s quality of life. Saying you&rsquo;re depressed because you finished the last episode of your latest binge-watching show discounts the fact that those with depression can experience debilitating symptoms.</p><p>&ldquo;When we talk that way, it trivializes the mental illness, and makes it into something that can become a joke. The impact of a joke on a person who really does have an illness could be serious,&rdquo; said Dr. Williams.</p><p><strong>4. Judging or teasing someone for abnormal behavior</strong></p><p>Dr. Williams shared examples of her patients being made fun of for their symptoms.</p><p>&ldquo;People with mental illness can be mocked for, for example, hearing things that aren&rsquo;t there. People would make fun of that and say &lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s just hearing voices again&rsquo; or &lsquo;Can you hear me now?&rsquo; Sometimes people will put those who are anxious in bad situations by saying &lsquo;It&rsquo;s crazy to be afraid of small spaces&rsquo; and then taking them to a small space to see how they&rsquo;ll act. If the person really has that phobia, it can cause a major problem.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Williams pointed out that you wouldn&rsquo;t joke about someone&rsquo;s physical illness, and the same should apply to mental illness.</p><p>&ldquo;Mocking someone for their symptoms &mdash; and that can go for someone with a physical illness as well &mdash; just goes against everything we know about how to treat people well,&rdquo; said Dr. Williams.</p><p><strong>5. Referring to people with mental illness as crazy or psycho</strong></p><p>The last thing someone living with mental illness needs is to be put down for their condition.</p><p>&ldquo;People with mental illness are sometimes thought of as crazy or insane. Any time we are put into a category based on just a piece of who we are, and placed in that category from a negative perspective, it affects our self-esteem. It makes us feel alienated, and can sometimes make our symptoms worse,&rdquo; said Dr. Williams.</p><p><strong>How do we change?</strong></p><p>If you&rsquo;ve done any of these things, you&rsquo;re not alone &mdash; we&rsquo;ve all made these mistakes. Dr. Williams says the best way to change these behaviors is to apply the Golden Rule: treat others as we would want to be treated.</p><p>&ldquo;The very best thing is to think, &lsquo;How would I respond if someone did this to me? What if someone took one of my behaviors and made fun of me for it?&rsquo; We have to develop empathy,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>She also suggested that people take note of accurate representations of mental illness in pop culture, like Silver Linings Playbook, one of her favorite movies depicting mental health.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to recognize when the professional mental health community points out a movie or a book that portrays mental illness correctly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They can help people understand what mental illness is really like, and start chipping away at stigmas. We need to develop a more tolerant society where we can see others in their full light.&rdquo;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Terri Tomlinson leads a healthy lifestyle. She enjoys playing with her granddaughter, doing yardwork and finishing remodeling projects on her home. The pediatric speech-language pathologist and manager at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Rehabilitation on the Baptist Clay Medical Campus said she had no family history of heart disease, and none of the risk factors.</p><p>But none of that prevented her from experiencing a &ldquo;widow-maker&rdquo; blockage, the telling term for a critical blockage in the main artery down the front of the heart. When the artery becomes 100 percent blocked, it causes a heart attack that often is fatal.</p><p><strong>From Party to Pains</strong></p><p>In March 2017, Tomlinson celebrated turning 60 with a party and going out dancing with friends. By April, she was frequently experiencing what felt like indigestion. The pains were sharp, and would happen even during simple activities like changing clothes. On Easter Sunday, she went to the emergency room. She was tested for a heart attack, but everything was normal.</p><p>Because Tomlinson thought it was a digestive issue, she followed up with her primary care physician, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/internist/dr-amanda-bagby-md\" target=\"_blank\">Amanda Bagby, MD</a>. Just in case, Dr. Bagby referred Tomlinson to <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a>, knowing that the symptoms of heart disease in women can look and feel like other conditions. Here, Tomlinson met cardiologist <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-praveen-kanaparti-md\" target=\"_blank\">Praveen Kanaparti, MD</a>.</p><p>By this time, her symptoms had become episodes. &ldquo;There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to it,&rdquo; said Tomlinson. &ldquo;I could wake up relaxed, sitting at my desk or bending over to put on my shoes and it would happen. I started timing the episodes and they always lasted five to six minutes, and then would go away. It wasn&rsquo;t like a shooting pain down my arms. They would feel tired and achy. It would start in my chest and radiate toward my shoulders.&rdquo;</p><p>Tomlinson didn&rsquo;t recognize the warning signs of heart disease, just as many women don&rsquo;t. Unlike the telltale chest pain men experience, women will often feel discomfort or tightness in the shoulders, upper back or abdomen. They&rsquo;ll have pain in one or both arms, and experience unusual fatigue. For some women, these symptoms occur more often when they&rsquo;re resting, or even sleeping.</p><p><strong>Narrowing Down a Diagnosis</strong></p><p>Dr. Kanaparti ran a series of diagnostic heart tests. When they all came back normal outside of a small discrepancy on the stress test, he devised a plan.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The next day, Dr. Kanaparti gave me nitroglycerin. He said if it worked, we&rsquo;d know it was my heart,&rdquo; said Tomlinson. Nitroglycerin is prescribed to stop severe chest pains by widening the blood vessels, allowing blood to flow normally despite any blockages. During her next episode of chest pain, Tomlinson placed a nitroglycerin tablet under her tongue. It ended the pain in two minutes, confirming that something was amiss with her heart.</p><p>Tomlinson went for a CT scan to find any blocked arteries. When she returned for her results, Dr. Kanaparti presented her scan and pointed to the widow maker, a 96-percent blockage in her left anterior descending artery &mdash; the main artery feeding the heart.</p><p>&ldquo;It was surreal. I remember just staring at the screen not wanting to even breathe,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The personal attention and care from Dr. Kanaparti is something I will always remember. From that point, he did not leave my side. He picked up his phone and started making arrangements for emergency surgery and my transport. I went out to the lobby to call my husband and he came with me. It was about 50 minutes from the time of discovery to emergency surgery. He saved my life.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Healing the Heart</strong></p><p>After her stent was placed, Tomlinson had a smooth recovery and rebuilt her strength with help from <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/rehabilitation-services\" target=\"_blank\">Cardiac Rehabilitation at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>. While recovering, Tomlinson watched a procedure like hers on YouTube. That&rsquo;s when the gravity of her situation &mdash; and her survival &mdash; truly sank in.</p><p>&ldquo;It was gut-wrenching to think I could have had complete devastation when I was gardening, alone with my granddaughter or in my sleep. I praise God for having His hand on me.&rdquo;</p><p>Tomlinson&rsquo;s story was highlighted at the 2018 First Coast Go Red for Women Luncheon on May 18. She also walked in the event&rsquo;s fashion show, escorted by Michael Mayo, president of Baptist Jacksonville.</p><p>&ldquo;The reason I&rsquo;m doing this is to encourage women to go get checked because this can happen to anybody,&rdquo; said Tomlinson. &ldquo;My message is, if something isn&rsquo;t right, listen to your intuition and push for action. Without that, and the attention of the Baptist Health staff, I would not have survived. We truly have an amazing system here at Baptist when I look back at all that happened.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Time is brain. The faster you can recognize the symptoms of stroke and get help, the better the chances of survival and recovery.</p><p>Recently, the window for treating a stroke has expanded to allow medication and intervention to be successfully used anywhere from six to 24 hours after a stroke occurs. That means people who have a stroke overnight and wake up with symptoms can still be treated. It also allows people who live in remote areas to be treated later.</p><p>We all need to remember the message that time is brain, and treat the signs of stroke as a life-threatening emergency. But it is reassuring to know that there are options for those who might otherwise not have a chance to receive life-saving treatment.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-center\">The Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center at Baptist Health&nbsp;</a>is changing the outlook on stroke treatment and recovery. New interventions by expert hands and new clinical trials close to home are helping to rewrite thousands of stroke stories.</p><p>Most strokes happen when a blood vessel becomes obstructed by a clot. This type of stroke is an ischemic stroke. When the brain cells are deprived of blood, they begin to die, disrupting speech, movement and essential functions. A medication called tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) can dissolve clots and reopen clogged blood vessels in the brain.</p><p>The window for administering the medication known as tPA has been expanding for years. Now, new endovascular interventions allow highly trained neurosurgeons to access the brain via a catheter in the leg to physically &ldquo;unclog&rdquo; areas affected by a stroke.</p><p>Two clinical trials, DAWN and POSITIVE, which Baptist Health participated in, helped to change the stroke guidelines with the American Heart Association. Both tPA administration and new minimally invasive procedures to remove the stroke were included in DAWN and POSITIVE.&nbsp;</p><p>Patients who would benefit the most from the new guidelines are those who show up in the emergency room past the conventional window of treatment with signs of stroke that is determined to be an ischemic stroke &ndash; where there is blockage in a blood vessel. If the patient meets the medical criteria, his or her treatment window can be expanded up to 24 hours.&nbsp;</p><p>The expanding window of treatment, thanks to new technology and expertise, enables people to live longer and fuller lives than previous generations touched by stroke. The Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center at Baptist Health manages more than 20 clinical trials for advanced treatment of stroke and aneurysms.

They&rsquo;re good diets, but there just aren&rsquo;t the randomized, controlled studies to back them up.&rdquo;</p><p>The eating plan, adapted from the lifestyle of those in the Mediterranean region, consists of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, olive oil, herbs and spices; fish and seafood at least a couple of times a week; and poultry, eggs, cheese and yogurt in moderation, while saving sweets and red meat for special occasions. While the Mediterranean eating plan doesn&rsquo;t restrict or eliminate any nutrient, it does discourage dairy and processed sugars, Dr. Rama added.</p><p>Alcohol is also allowed in moderation, so you don&rsquo;t have to cancel wine night just yet. Exercising is a Mediterranean health plan requirement, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be dreaded! Walking can be a step in the right direction, but doctors also suggest trying something a <a href=\"https://qa.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/wellness/work-out-where-the-membership-is-always-free\">little bit more fun</a>. &ldquo;It needs to be something you will stick with,&rdquo; Dr. Rama recommended.</p><p>But why does the Mediterranean eating pattern work so well?</p><p>According to Dr. Rama, every time a person eats foods high in concentrated sugars and triglycerides, a type of fat found in the blood, there is a correlated spike in inflammatory markers and insulin approximately two hours after the meal. This causes the release of superoxide and free radicals, which can ultimately result in changes to our DNA.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1522247522/Juice/Mediterranean_Diet_infographicJuice.jpg\" alt=\"Mediterranean Diet infographic\"></div><p>&ldquo;We know that cardiovascular disease and cancers are promoted by <a href=\"https://qa.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/wellness/how-to-quiet-that-smoldering-fire-inside-you\">inflammation</a>, so you can see how a bad diet would increase the risk,&rdquo; Dr. Rama added.</p><p>Shortly after World War II, a scientist named Ancel Keys and his colleagues studied people in seven countries to see if the Mediterranean eating pattern contributed to improved health outcomes. Data from the United States, Japan, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Finland and then-Yugoslavia also showed that people who ate a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, grains, beans and fish were the healthiest.</p><p>Since then, hundreds of studies have proven eating the &ldquo;Med way&rdquo; may &mdash; in addition to the heart health benefits &mdash; help lengthen your life, improve brain function, fight certain cancers, protect from diabetes, keep away depression, aid weight loss and more.</p><p>Seems like the <em>U.S. News and World Report&nbsp;</em>got it right.</p><p><br></p>",

Why? Because that&rsquo;s not what your car runs on, and it definitely isn&rsquo;t what the vehicle needs to maintain a healthy engine.</p><p>Your brain is the same. When you feed your body a clean, healthy diet, brain function improves. Not just mental clarity, either. Food can help reduce depression, eliminate anxiety and boost energy levels.</p><p>In fact, Karen McNeely, DNP, ARNP-BC, with<a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-behavioral-health\">&nbsp;Baptist Behavioral Health</a>, says the old adage is true: You are what you eat.</p><p>&ldquo;We know there is a direct line of communication between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract,&rdquo; McNeely said. &ldquo;We are also learning more every day about the role of inflammation in psychiatric disorders, particularly depression and anxiety. So, we believe diets should be rich in foods that promote cellular health and reduce that inflammation.&rdquo;</p><p>What foods should you gravitate toward?&nbsp;</p><p>Some mood-boosting foods include bananas, oats, blueberries, avocados, spinach, eggs, walnuts and even dark chocolate.</p><p>These actually increase serotonin in the body. The right amount of this neurotransmitter, a chemical that allows cells to communicate, produces a relaxed and positive feeling, and it is responsible for regulating things like appetite and sleep. Approximately 90 percent of serotonin in our bodies, however, is found in the gut.</p><p>&ldquo;What we eat can determine how we feel, but the opposite is also true,&rdquo; McNeely said. &ldquo;How we feel can determine what we eat. It is important to eat a variety of healthy foods as they all have a different effect on our brains.&rdquo;</p><p>Carbohydrates increase serotonin, which is likely why people crave carbohydrate-rich foods when they&rsquo;re stressed. Protein-rich food, on the other hand, increases the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine. Both play a role in aiding mental acuity.</p><p>So, how do you give your body the food it needs? A couple of &nbsp;quick tips will help defog your mind and improve your mental health:</p><ul><li>Space each meal and snack approximately 3 to 4 hours apart.</li><li>Always eat a healthy protein and carbohydrate source at each meal.</li><li>Keep track of the foods that make you feel healthy &mdash; and those that make you feel down.</li></ul><p>Eating a wide variety of foods, including whole grains, fruits and vegetables, will provide the nutrients needed to support a healthy mind and body.</p><p>&ldquo;Even small changes make a difference because small changes often lead to bigger changes. <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/juice/Stories/wellness/8-steps-to-mindful-eating\">Mindful eating&nbsp;</a>is the best way to integrate these changes,&rdquo; McNeely said.</p><p>She added, &nbsp;&ldquo;Good nutrition is an important component of an improved mood and an increased sense of wellbeing, but it is not a substitute for medical care.&rdquo;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

Did you take the time to savor it? Ain&#39;t nobody got time for that. Not anymore, at least.&nbsp;</p><p>You are not alone. A lot of us probably ate something in the last few hours and can&#39;t even remember everything we ate.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a 2011 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average American spends two-and-a-half hours a day eating and more than half the time, we are also doing something else. We browse social media, text, read work emails, or watch television. This mindless eating makes us unaware of what we are eating.</p><p>So, how exactly do we eat mindfully?</p><p>Mindful eating is allowing yourself to become aware of the positive and nurturing opportunities that are available through food selection and preparation by respecting your own inner wisdom. In essence, mindful eating<a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/y-healthy-living-centers/northside-dunn-ave\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a>means being fully attentive to your food&mdash;as you buy, prepare, serve and consume it. Regardless of your eating goals, mindfulness can help introduce a healthy relationship between you and the food that nourished your body.</p><p>Here are 8 steps to mindful eating:</p><ol><li><strong>Begin with a shopping list.&nbsp;</strong>Make a list and stick to it, avoiding those hard to resist impulses at the grocery store. Try to avoid the center aisle and fill your cart with items from the produce section.</li><li>&nbsp;<strong>Come to the table with an appetite, but not ravenous.&nbsp;</strong>Health snacking between meals will prevent that ravenous feeling at dinner time.</li><li><strong>Start with a small portion.</strong> Limit the size of your plate to 9 inches or less. The bigger the plate is, the more food you will want to stack on it.</li><li><strong>Appreciate your food.</strong> Pause for a minute or two before you begin eating. Silently express your gratitude for the opportunity to enjoy delicious food and the companions you&#39;re enjoying it with.</li><li><strong>Bring all your senses to the meal.</strong> When you&#39;re cooking, serving, and eating your food, be attentive to color, texture, and aroma.</li><li><strong>Take small bites</strong>. When your mouth isn&rsquo;t full, it is easier to taste all your food completely.</li><li><strong>Chew thoroughly.</strong> Chew each mouthful 20-40 times depending on the type of food. Chew until you taste all the essence of the food.</li><li><strong>Eat slowly.</strong> If you follow step 7, you won&rsquo;t bolt your food down. Take the time to enjoy every bite and pause in between putting the fork down.</li></ol><p><br></p><p><em>Diana Rosito is a wellness coach at the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/y-healthy-living-centers/northside-dunn-ave\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Y Healthy Living Center at Baptist Medical Center North</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

And pushing. And pushing. The baby was &ldquo;sunny side up,&rdquo; in the posterior fetal position, where the back of the baby&rsquo;s head is against the mother&rsquo;s back, making birth difficult.</p><p>And then things literally took a turn. Once the baby&rsquo;s head was delivered, another obstacle was evident &ndash; the baby&rsquo;s shoulder was stuck under Silveira&rsquo;s pubic bone. Called shoulder dystocia, this can be extremely dangerous for baby and Mom.</p><p>&ldquo;This is an emergency situation, making delivery much more complicated,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/obstetrician-and-gynecologist/dr-nikita-wilkes-md\">Nikita Wilkes, MD,</a> Silveira&rsquo;s obstetrician who delivers at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-south\">Baptist Medical Center South.</a> Typically, there&rsquo;s only about a six-minute window to prevent brain damage. Other injuries could include a fractured collarbone or arm, and some babies develop a brachial plexus injury, where the nerves tear away from the spinal cord.</p><p>Silveira&rsquo;s nurse, Katie Coleman, BSN, RN, who has training in emergency births, knew exactly what to do. Without hesitation, she performed the McRoberts Maneuver, in which the mom&rsquo;s legs are hyperflexed back toward the abdomen. At the same time, Coleman applied tremendous pelvic pressure to dislodge the shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Katie literally got on top of me and pushed down on me with all her strength,&rdquo; Silveira said. The maneuver worked and a few minutes later, baby Lukah, weighing a whopping 10 lbs., 10 oz., was born.</p><p>All new Baptist South Labor &amp; Delivery nurses go through 16-week boot camp so they are fully prepared to handle emergency births. &ldquo;We all have a role and we all know what to do,&rdquo; said Coleman.</p><p>To make sure baby Lukah was fine, he spent one night at Baptist South&rsquo;s Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), which is conveniently located on the same floor as the Labor &amp; Delivery unit. As a Level II NICU, Baptist South is able to provide advanced medical treatment for moderately ill newborns. Babies who have more critical needs are transferred to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital&rsquo;s Level III NICU.</p><p>Fortunately, Lukah was able to return to his mom the next morning. X-rays showed no damage to his bones and that he was deemed completely healthy and ready to go home.</p><p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for Katie, Dr. Wilkes and the other nurses I had &ndash; Christine Cobb and Cami Sykes &ndash; I would not be cuddling my son today,&rdquo; said Silveira. &ldquo;I will always remember their love and care.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you are planning to get pregnant and need an obstetrician near you, visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/pregnancy-and-childbirth\"><em>Baptist Health&#39;s maternity services.</em></a><em>&nbsp;If you are currently pregnant, you can register for a&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/patient-info/classes-and-events/maternity-suite-tour\"><em>free maternity tour</em></a><em>&nbsp;at any of our Baptist Health hospitals.</em>&nbsp;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Any woman who delivers her baby vaginally will experience a number of changes to her pelvic floor. It&rsquo;s all part of the birth process, and it&rsquo;s unique to each mother.</p><p>&ldquo;Birth is as different for every woman as pregnancy is, and what you experience afterward during recovery is just as different,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-patricia-calhoun-md\" target=\"_blank\">Patricia Calhoun, MD, FAAFP,</a> medical director of Women&rsquo;s Health Strategy at Baptist Health.</p><p>The pelvic floor is group of muscles and ligaments that stretch across the pelvic bones. It supports all your pelvic organs, including your bladder, bowels, uterus and vagina.</p><p>&ldquo;It encompasses all the female muscles that help us control our urine, control our bowel function, and also contribute to our sexuality,&rdquo; said Dr. Calhoun.</p><p>During vaginal childbirth, pushing seven to eight pounds of baby out through the pelvic floor can, unsurprisingly, put some stress on a mother&rsquo;s body.</p><p>&ldquo;When that happens, there is stretching of the muscles of the pelvic floor. Sometimes there are partial or more significant tears, and sometimes there&rsquo;s an episiotomy (an incision made in the perineum during childbirth). Fortunately there&rsquo;s a lot of stretch down there but when those muscles stretch, they still have to get back to normal.&rdquo;</p><p>While recovering at home, moms may notice some urinary incontinence or discomfort. But Dr. Calhoun says any issues occurring after childbirth should be brought to your doctor&rsquo;s attention, especially if they affect your quality of life.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re experiencing urinary or bowel incontinence after delivery, you should definitely talk with your OB/GYN,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Some other red flags would be fever, unusual pain, or if you&rsquo;re just unsure whether or not what&rsquo;s happening is normal.&rdquo;</p><p>For mothers of more than one child, particularly if they were delivered vaginally, keeping the pelvic floor strong is especially important. Dr. Calhoun said with each pregnancy, the weight of the uterus places more strain and stress on the &ldquo;sling&rdquo; of the pelvic floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Multiple pregnancies can lead to more pelvic floor and incontinence issues, so it&rsquo;s important to keep those exercises up,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>So how can new and veteran moms get their pelvic floor back in shape?</p><p>&ldquo;Your recovery may take weeks to months to feel back to normal, and quite honestly, the body may never get back to as tight a pelvic floor musculature as before vaginal delivery,&rdquo; Dr. Calhoun explained. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t be functional and you can&rsquo;t have continence and pleasurable intercourse, but things are going to be different. I&rsquo;ve delivered five babies and I understand. Doing pelvic exercises were key for me for long-term pelvic floor health, but you have to do them correctly.&rdquo;</p><p>Kegels are the most well-known pelvic floor exercise, but all the Kegels in the world won&rsquo;t do any good unless they&rsquo;re done properly.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a large number of people who just don&rsquo;t do them correctly,&rdquo; said Dr. Calhoun. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you might want to consider going through a program like Baptist Health&rsquo;s Total Control program, part of the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/4her-center-for-women\" target=\"_blank\">4her Center for Women</a>. It&rsquo;s a medical exercise program for strengthening your pelvic floor muscles, lower back muscles and abdominal muscles because they all contribute to pelvic health. It&rsquo;s an evidence-based program and a no-medication, nonsurgical way to improve issues related to incontinence.&rdquo;</p><p>Ultimately, there&#39;s no way to avoid trauma to the pelvic floor during childbirth, but learning proper exercises for the pelvic floor muscles and surrounding muscle groups can help strengthen them once again. Most importantly, a new mom should see her OB/GYN right away if she is experiencing anything concerning after giving birth so together, they can get her back to normal.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>It only takes five minutes to die from blood loss. No matter how fast emergency medical personnel can reach someone who is hemorrhaging, bystanders are almost always first on the scene.</p><p>Even without formal medical training, you can help. But unlike what you might have learned about CPR, where the focus is ABC (Airway/Breathing/Circulation), in a trauma situation, your priority is to stop the bleeding.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/emergency-medical-specialist/dr-michael-mccann-do\" target=\"_blank\">Michael McCann, DO</a>, an emergency medicine physician with Baptist Health, said there are simple steps you can take to keep an injured person alive while waiting for medical help.</p><ol><li>Secure the scene. Make sure you and the victim are safe, and the threat that led to the individual&rsquo;s injuries is contained.</li><li>Apply direct pressure. While someone else calls 911, you should apply firm pressure to the bleeding site with your hands, cupping them around the affected extremity like a clamshell.</li><li>Apply a compression bandage. If you can&rsquo;t control the bleeding with pressure alone, Dr. McCann recommends moving to the next step: applying a pressure dressing. &ldquo;These are commercially available and should be in everyone&rsquo;s first aid kits &mdash; at home, at the office and in the car,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have a compression bandage, you can improvise one with clothing or anything you can tie into a knot around the extremity.&rdquo;</li><li>Apply a tourniquet. Dr. McCann said, &ldquo;If there is still a lot of bleeding and the pressure isn&rsquo;t working, move on to applying a tourniquet. A tourniquet can help you apply even firmer pressure to specific arteries, such as the brachial (under the arm) or femoral (in the groin) arteries, where bleeding is especially life-threatening.&rdquo;</li></ol><p>If you don&rsquo;t have a combat application tourniquet, Dr. McCann said you can improvise one with a belt. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use anything that isn&rsquo;t a couple of inches wide. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to wrap a thin electrical/power cord or similar around an extremity as it is too thin and will cut the skin and make the situation worse.&rdquo;</p><p>For a severe bleed from the femoral artery that the tourniquet isn&rsquo;t controlling, you can apply greater pressure by placing your knee directly in the space between the leg and the groin. &ldquo;Using your knee can be much more effective than just using your hands,&rdquo; Dr. McCann said.</p><div style=\"position: relative; display: block; max-width: 100%;\"><div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"//players.brightcove.net/4709052668001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5788269107001\" allowfullscreen=\"\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div></div><p>Bystanders may feel like they shouldn&rsquo;t touch someone who is injured or fear they will hurt them further. &ldquo;Remember, you can only improve the situation when someone has a significant hemorrhage, the No. 1 cause of death for trauma victims,&rdquo; said Dr. McCann. &ldquo;When you only have minutes and someone is at great risk of dying, it&rsquo;s very difficult to do more harm to an individual.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>From scene to help</strong></p><p>Tragic events in recent years, including mass shootings and bombings, have clearly demonstrated that bystanders at the scene can play a critical role in saving lives.</p><p>&ldquo;If you can help control an injured person&rsquo;s bleeding and help stabilize them, it&rsquo;s more likely they will survive so Emergency Medical Services (EMS) can take over and get them to appropriate medical care,&rdquo; Dr. McCann said. &ldquo;We have a saying in trauma: get the victim as quickly as possible to the &lsquo;hot lights and cold steel&rsquo; of the OR, where injuries can be best treated.&rdquo;</p><p>Although formal training isn&rsquo;t required, Dr. McCann suggests that people who are interested in being even more prepared take a course like <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/stopthebleed\" target=\"_blank\">Stop the Bleed</a>, a program developed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. This training can not only help you be better prepared to help others, but participants also learn how to save themselves, as well.</p><p><strong>Bystanders&rsquo; trauma first aid kit</strong></p><p>Dr. McCann suggested people expand their basic first aid kits by adding the following items, all of which are commercially available:</p><ul><li>Personal protective gear such as gloves and a face mask</li><li>Hemostatic (clotting) gauze</li><li>Scissors</li><li>Compression bandages (Dr. McCann recommends Israeli compression bandages)</li><li>Combat-application tourniquets</li><li>Pediatric tourniquets</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Also, make sure your trauma first aid kit is easily accessible, wherever you store it,&rdquo; Dr. McCann said.</p><p><br></p><p><em>An emergency medicine physician with&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.ergjax.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Emergency Resources Group</em></a><em>&nbsp;and Baptist Health, Dr. McCann practices at the Emergency Centers at Baptist Medical Center Beaches, Town Center and North.</em></p><p><br></p><div class=\"u-size2of2 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><br></div>",

Her incontinence was getting progressively worse and she felt safer at home, where nobody would notice her problem.</p><p>&ldquo;Every time I sneezed, laughed or coughed, I wet myself. I was running to the restroom constantly, so I stopped going places unless I absolutely had to,&rdquo; said Hinton. It got even worse when her allergies kicked in, causing spontaneous coughing spells.</p><p>Bladder surgery in 2005 had not solved the problem, and Hinton thought she had run out of options. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t work the first time, so I was hesitant to try again,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was missing out on so much.&rdquo;</p><p>After 10 years of frustration, Hinton&rsquo;s primary care physician sent her to see urogynecologist <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/urologist-gynecologist/dr-lee-epstein-md\" target=\"_blank\">Lee Epstein, MD</a>, who specializes in pelvic floor disorders and is on the medical staff at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-beaches\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Beaches</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;About a quarter of all women in our country suffer with at least one pelvic floor problem,&rdquo; said Dr. Epstein, who is dual board-certified in gynecology and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery.</p><p>For women older than 60, the number of women with pelvic floor problems rises to 40 percent, he said. The most common conditions are urinary frequency, urinary or fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse (commonly called fallen bladder or bowel).</p><p>&ldquo;The majority of women with these types of conditions suffer in silence,&rdquo; said Dr. Epstein. &ldquo;Many are too embarrassed to bring it up to their doctor. Other women think these conditions are just a normal part of aging, but they are not.&rdquo;</p><p>For Hinton, Dr. Epstein recommended a procedure to implant a suburethral strap that acts as a new support for the urethra to prevent urine leakage. With a 90 percent success rate, almost no scar and very little down time, she was sold.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1529951256/GPL-Studios-Bea-Hinton-042mainJuice_nra7cf.jpg\" alt=\"Bea Hinton\"></div><p>Hinton had the 20-minute procedure as an outpatient and went home that same day with a catheter that doctors removed the next day.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Parenting can be stressful, especially if you&rsquo;re juggling multiple responsibilities in different areas of your life.&nbsp;</p><p>While stress may be unavoidable, managing stress every day is key to enjoying life with your children. Children whose caregivers effectively manage their emotional responses learn to manage their responses, too. These children are often happier and easier to parent.</p><p>&nbsp;Here are six ways to enjoy the time you have with your children in a relaxed manner.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Set aside 20-30 minutes each day to bond with your child without distractions like TV or the Internet</strong>. Dinner is a perfect time for this kind of shared experience. Don&rsquo;t just ask questions. Engage them on their terms and see where the conversation takes you. This tactic won&rsquo;t add to your &ldquo;to-do&rdquo; list, and it demonstrates to your child that you care about what&rsquo;s really going on in his/her life. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if you find out something new about the child you thought you knew so well. That alone may reduce your parenting stress.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Take care of your own physical health</strong>. Good eating habits, regular exercise and plenty of rest go a long way to keeping mood and anxiety on an even keel when life gets stressful.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Prepare for the morning the night before</strong>. Choose clothes, pack backpacks and make lunches in the evening. Get up a few minutes earlier and get yourself ready first before you help your children get ready. A little additional preparation makes the morning go smoothly and keeps everyone calm.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Relax your standards</strong>. Life will go on if the laundry stays in the drier a bit longer. Being a perfectionist might keep you from appreciating the little things your children are trying to share with you. It&rsquo;s OK to put off that household chore in order to sit down and read a story or just talk with your kids.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>E</strong><strong>very day, do something you really enjoy</strong>. It might be a yoga class or a walk in the park. Sometimes you can include your family in your activities &ndash; or take a friend. Whatever you do, take a few minutes of &ldquo;me time&rdquo; each day.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Teach your children to be more independent and to help around the house</strong>. Give them developmentally appropriate chores to do, and have them take over aspects of their own care. Not only will this reduce your workload, it will give them a sense of accomplishment and contribution, which are important to their own growth.</li></ol><p>Sometimes even the best effort at managing life&rsquo;s stressors is not enough to keep symptoms of depression and anxiety under control. If you have periods of more than two weeks where you find yourself feeling helpless or hopeless, struggling to find energy or motivation to engage in life, have increased or reduced appetite, have trouble sleeping, feel very worried or have a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities, realize that you may need some additional help to get back on track.&nbsp;</p><p>See your primary care provider or <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a> (904.376.3800) for an evaluation to determine if additional treatment would be helpful.</p>",

Memory issues affect about 40 percent of people over 65, about 16 million in the U.S.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s not just older folks. Today&rsquo;s fast-paced society, with its many distractions, makes anyone vulnerable to an occasional brain snafu.</p><p>So what can you do to sharpen your memory?</p><p>&ldquo;Repetition is the key to memory,&rdquo; said Lynda Gridley, a speech-language pathologist at Baptist <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/agewell-center-for-senior-health\">AgeWell Center for Senior Health.</a> Surprisingly, speech-language pathologists can help patients with memory disorders due to their expertise in the connection between language and cognition.</p><p><strong>Our 5 best memory tips</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Repeat after me.</strong> Our brains are wired for repetition, so writing something down after thinking it or repeating it aloud (like when you meet someone new) reinforces it in your mind. While smartphones are great for making lists, the physical act of writing something down is more effective in registering names and items in your mind. Some people find that having dry-erase board at home or work helps, even though items are eventually erased. Again, it&rsquo;s the physical act of writing things down that does the trick.</p></li><li><p><strong>Load up on brain food</strong>. Did you know that just one serving of leafy, green vegetables a day can improve your brain aging by 11 years? Rush University Medical Center in Chicago recently released a study that proves it, showing a slower rate of decline on memory tests and thinking skills than people who rarely or never ate veggies like spinach, kale, collard greens, or lettuce. Leafy greens also have plenty of Vitamin C and B, which are shown to improve memory. If you aren&rsquo;t a fan of leafy greens, take supplements of these vitamins.</p><p>Foods high in antioxidants, like those found in the Mediterranean diet, are shown to boost memory. In fact, a study from the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association shows that following the Mediterranean diet may lower your risk of developing cognitive impairment by up to 35 percent.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Move that body!</strong> Although we usually think of exercise being good for our bods, it&rsquo;s also good for your brain. This is because getting your heart rate up appears to increase the size of the hippocampus &ndash; the area of the brain involved with memory and learning. It also releases chemicals in the brain that promote healthy brain cells and the growth of new brain cells. And it doesn&rsquo;t take much; just 150 minutes of aerobic exercise a week will help. (Strength training and balance exercises don&rsquo;t have the same effect.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Exercise your brain.</strong> No need to learn calculus or Chinese (unless you want to!); brain games don&rsquo;t have to be complicated. Try doing familiar things in a different way &ndash; like writing with your non-dominant hand or simply taking a different route on your walk or run. Or relearn an old skill like dusting off that clarinet from high school band or picking up your tennis racket again. Crossword puzzles and numbers games work, too, but make sure you are being challenged. Struggling a bit is what benefits the brain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Get out there and be social.</strong> This is especially helpful for older adults. The <em>American Journal of Psychiatric Healt</em>h published a study that showed social support helps protect against dementia. And another study in Psychology Today shows that people who connect with others generally perform better on memory tests. So, volunteer, take a class, join a book club&hellip;whatever will get you interacting with others. And don&rsquo;t feel guilty for lingering at the coffee shop chatting away. The socialization will help you remember all those items on your &ldquo;to-do&rdquo; list!&nbsp;</p></li></ol>",

Summertime here in Florida is full of sun, sand and the ocean &mdash; but it&rsquo;s also when we are outside the most.</p><p>To make sure we keep the fun, let&rsquo;s talk about how to stay safe in the sun.</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 76,000 people in the U.S. were diagnosed with melanomas of the skin in 2014, and 9,000 of those died from this preventable cancer. This makes skin cancer the most common form of cancer in the United States, with melanoma being the deadliest.</p><p>Surprisingly, skin damages from the sun&rsquo;s harmful rays in as little as 15 minutes of unprotected exposure. So, consider a two-hour beach trip. If you don&rsquo;t apply sunscreen, you can get eight times the damage! But, with the proper skin protection, you can have minimal to no skin damage in these same two hours.</p><p>Which would you choose?</p><p>Sun exposure is actually the most preventable risk factor for skin cancer. This is a good thing, because it means that we can control how much sun we actually get &mdash; and then, in turn, reduce our risk for skin cancer. &nbsp;</p><p>With all this talk about how the sun can hurt your skin, I&#39;m sure you are thinking: &ldquo;what are some ways to protect my skin?&rdquo;</p><p>The first thing that comes to mind for many of us is to get a base tan. Sorry to burst your bubble, but there&rsquo;s no other way to say it&mdash;there is no such thing as a &quot;base tan.&quot; Tanned skin is damaged skin. Any change in the color of your skin after time outside&mdash;whether sunburn or suntan&mdash;indicates damage from UV rays. This also means that even if you have darker skin, you still need to protect it.</p><p>If this hasn&#39;t convinced you, just know that damage from the sun is the number one cause of premature aging of the skin. Follow this simple guide from the CDC to not only protect your skin, but also keep up its youthful appearance!</p><p><strong>Slip, Slop, Slap, Seek, Slide</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Slip&nbsp;</strong>on some protective clothing.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>An employee at Universal&#39;s Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Fla., is gaining praise from around the world for recognizing a little boy&#39;s breakdown as more than an ordinary tantrum. While other people stared at and walked around the crying and screaming 9-year-old, Jen Whelchel chose empathy over judgement and laid down on the floor with the boy, who has autism.&nbsp;</p><p>The simple gesture meant everything to the boy&#39;s parents.</p><p>According to the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in 59 children has autism spectrum disorder (ASD), up from one in 69 just two years prior.</p><p>ASD is a developmental condition characterized by difficulty with communication and social interaction.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In recent years, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders broadened the criteria for diagnosing children with autism, helping professionals better identify children who show early signs,&rdquo; said Lauren Papke, SLP, a pediatric speech-language pathologist with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Rehabilitation Services and team lead for the <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/services/rehabilitation/early-autism-intervention-program\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Rehabilitation Autism and Neurodevelopment Center</a>. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still a marked increase year after year and researchers aren&rsquo;t quite sure why.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-infectious-disease-specialist/dr-mobeen-rathore-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mobeen Rathore, MD,</a> is chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease and Immunology for <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>. He agreed with Papke that more definitive answers aren&rsquo;t available.</p><p>&ldquo;Studies such as this one from the CDC help us adequately prepare to treat the volume of children who need our services. But we can&rsquo;t attribute this increase to any one thing,&rdquo; said Dr. Rathore. &ldquo;Unfortunately, when it comes to autism, there are things we just don&rsquo;t know yet.&rdquo;</p><p>There is evidence that Dr. Rathore and Papke are right about why the rate of diagnosis is rising. Providers are identifying signs of autism earlier in patients&rsquo; lives than ever before &mdash; Dr. Rathore sees many patients who are diagnosed between eight months and two years of age.</p><p>The definition of autism has also changed over the years. Treating the condition as a spectrum rather than a strict set of traits means children may be flagged for evaluation sooner, and then receive services earlier. While these factors may be why diagnoses are up, experts still can&rsquo;t pinpoint what causes autism spectrum disorder is in the first place. However, one reason has been safely ruled out.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what causes autism,&rdquo; Dr. Rathore said. &ldquo;There are lots of theories being researched. I can tell you what does not cause autism: vaccines. That myth, based on a now-debunked study, has been put to rest by innumerable studies. We need to continue investigating what does cause autism and how we can manage it even better.&rdquo;</p><p>As researchers work toward answers, how can parents know if their child&rsquo;s development is cause for concern?</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a difficult challenge. My own son, who graduated from Harvard, didn&rsquo;t walk until he was 12 months old or speak until 14 months. My family was very concerned,&rdquo; said Dr. Rathore. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s most important is to maintain regular visits with the child&rsquo;s pediatrician. If you notice something different about your child, bring it up with your child&rsquo;s pediatrician and ask for an assessment early on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are many signs and symptoms of autism, but what parents need to be focusing on are lack of eye contact and limited shared smiles with their caregivers,&rdquo; explained Papke. &ldquo;They may have a lower verbal word count compared to other children their age, and they may have difficulty following directions.&rdquo;</p><p>Papke emphasized that early intervention is key in treating children with autism. &ldquo;We need to start treatment before the age of four,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, we have the Autism Early Intervention Program that specifically targets these young children with symptoms of autism. Our therapists are all certified in the Early Start Denver Model, which is the only scientifically proven treatment model for children with autism. We also work closely with the families to provide the child&rsquo;s caregivers with different strategies for interacting and supporting their child&rsquo;s development.&rdquo;</p><p>Concerned parents should discuss evaluation options with the child&rsquo;s doctor, who can recommend specialists to evaluate the child, help parents implement speech-language therapy and occupational therapy, and connect the family with invaluable community resources.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Whether you are a seasoned parent or new to the game, it&rsquo;s important to know the signs of overstimulation in your child. Babies go from the cozy, quiet womb out into the big, loud world &mdash; it can be a lot for a baby to take in. Here are some tips from Vicki Tierney, an occupational therapist with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>The best thing you can do to avoid overstimulating your infant is to stick to a predictable routine. While you might be ready to hit the town, head to lunch with friends, or do some shopping at Target, all of that activity could overstimulate your little one. When you do have baby in tow during errands, watch for signs that your baby has had enough and be prepared to cut the outing short should your baby be inconsolable.</p><ul><li>If your newborn is overstimulated, you may see them:</li><li>Appear limp with glassy eyes</li><li>Change colors and become red or splotchy</li><li>Cover their eyes or face</li><li>Cry excessively</li><li>Grimace</li><li>Turn their head away</li><li>Wave or kick arms and legs in an agitated way</li><li>Yawn or hiccup excessively</li></ul><p>When you see these signs of stress from your newborn, don&rsquo;t fret. There are several tried-and-true techniques to soothe your baby. Start by addressing any needs, like feeding or changing their diaper.</p><ol><li>Always check to see if your baby needs a clean diaper, a burp, or just a new position.</li><li>Reduce visual, auditory and social stimulation. Dim the lights and move to a quieter place.</li><li>Provide white noise such as the sound of a running dishwasher, a fan or easy listening music.</li><li>Offer their hand or pacifier to their mouth to suck.</li><li>Swaddle your baby in a blanket firmly, but not too tightly.</li><li>Properly secure your baby in their car seat and take them for a drive.</li></ol><p>When you see signs of overstimulation from your toddler, try to remove them from the situation, provide noise-reducing headphones or find a relaxing activity to focus on. It could just be time for a nap!</p><ul><li>If your toddler is overstimulated, you may see them:</li><li>Become angry or irritable with touching or holding</li><li>Become unreasonably cranky and irritable</li><li>Cry and become unable to use words to describe feelings</li><li>Refuse to be consoled</li><li>Throw a temper tantrum</li></ul><p>Calming a baby or toddler can be trying, even for the best of parents, and the process require a lot of trial and error. Experiment with some of these tips and see what works for you and your little one.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Your joints are designed to let you bend, twist and turn easily, within certain limits. The ends of your bones are covered with a layer of cartilage to cushion your joints and help spread the pressure you put on your joints during daily movement. Surrounding the joint is a capsule that holds a thick liquid (synovium) that lubricates the joint.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve ever felt a little creaky after sitting in the same position for more than two hours, you&rsquo;ve tested your body&rsquo;s lubricating capabilities. The more you move, the more lubrication moves through your joints.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.joionline.net/centers-of-expertise/joint-replacement/\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute&nbsp;</a>offers some simple ways to move more and keep your juices flowing while staying active:</p><ol><li><strong>Lubricate.&nbsp;</strong>Your joints&rsquo; lubricating fluid allows your joints to move with more ease and less stress. To activate those juices, start your exercise routine with a gentle 5-10-minute warm-up and gradually increase your effort. Another good way to self-lube is drinking more water.</li><li><strong>Stretch regularly.</strong> Daily exercise when coupled with regular stretching multiplies the effect on joints. Stretching opens blocked blood vessels and arteries to better blood flow, which leads to healthy joints. Stretching also removes stiffness and makes you more flexible.</li><li><strong>Strength train.</strong> Joints need protection. Your muscles, tendons and ligaments are designed to protect your joints. If they&#39;re weak, they can&#39;t do their job. A good way to build strength is through a training program designed by a physical therapist or personal coach, with your needs in mind. While you find a trainer, you might take a class or exercise to a video. The important thing is to be proactive and establish a regular exercise routine to help you avoid loss of strength and protect your joints.</li><li><strong>Give a little TLC.&nbsp;</strong>Joints need tender care. Trying to lift too much weight, overtraining, too much repetitive action, or just doing too much, will put a strain on your joints. Learn to listen to your body. We need to keep moving while being mindful about how we move and never push past joint pain.</li><li><strong>Cross-train.</strong> You don&rsquo;t have to be an athlete to learn to mix it up. This is just a fancy way of saying we should focus on more than one single activity. By cross-training -- doing a mix of sports or activities you enjoy -- you avoid the kind of single-sport repetitive motion that can cause joint problems over time. Changing your movement helps you develop muscles in areas untouched by your primary activity, and strong muscles help stabilize and protect your joints. If you&#39;re not sure where to start, try gentle yoga. It&#39;s an excellent way to keep your joints strong and flexible.</li><li><strong>Lose weight.&nbsp;</strong>The more weight you carry, the more stress to your joints. Every pound you lose equates to four pounds less pressure on your knees. Talk to your doctor about a good plan for you. Eat fresh, whole foods prepared at home in modest amounts, include lots of fruits and vegetables, and less sugar. Read Move It to Lose It.</li><li><strong>Take a warm shower or bath.&nbsp;</strong>Warm water will ease pressure on joints and muscles. A nice warm bath can do wonders for alleviating joint pain in your knees and hips. Immerse the affected area in the water and massage it to stimulate blood flow.</li><li><strong>Get your ZZZs.</strong> Giving your joints appropriate rest is good for maintaining their health. Are you getting about eight hours of sleep a night? During the day, it&rsquo;s okay to take a break to relax and alleviate stress on your joints. Adequate rest takes away muscle fatigue after workouts as well.&nbsp;</li></ol>",

From changing diapers and cleaning up messes to getting kids from point A to B, each day can turn into a hectic race that leaves a mom little time for herself.</p><p>It&rsquo;s difficult to find even a sliver of time to decompress when you&rsquo;re always on the go and have a family depending on you, but taking time out for yourself is important to your physical and mental health, something moms notoriously overlook. There are ways to make &ldquo;me time&rdquo; a priority, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-patricia-calhoun-md\" target=\"_blank\">Patricia McFall Calhoun, MD</a>, a family physician with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care/locations\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a> Mandarin North, and the mother of five boys. Becoming run down and burned out are two things you and your family can&rsquo;t afford.</p><p>&ldquo;At the very least, strive for 30 minutes of walking or physical activity each day, and aim for adequate sleep of 7 to 9 hours per night,&rdquo; recommended Dr. Calhoun. &ldquo;Even if you don&rsquo;t have half-an-hour, take the few minutes you can find to take a quick walk or meditate in a quiet place.&rdquo;</p><p>Sticking with healthy habits should also be a goal. Skipping meals, eating something on the fly and eating foods that are unhealthy can take a toll on your health. You need energy now more than ever, and being properly fueled is vital. That goes for making sure your soul is fed, too. To keep your mind, body and spirit relaxed, try some aromatherapy (the scent of peppermint, vanilla and pine can energize you), and try to set aside time for a massage or a yoga class to stay refreshed.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help from family or friends,&rdquo; suggested Dr. Calhoun. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to do it all without paying a price. As far as your to-do list goes, prioritizing and being willing to delegate can help you manage it, as well as opening up a few moments for yourself and reducing your stress.&rdquo;</p><p>She added that it&rsquo;s also important to assert yourself graciously and learn to say no. Saying yes when you really mean no can leave you feeling resentful and overwhelmed.</p><p>Another source of stress is isolation, and lots of new or stay-at-home moms tend to feel out of the loop and lonely because they spend so much time in the house, and have limited adult companionship. Reach out to friends and family, and join in on kid-friendly events so all of you can spend some time out doing things you like with others in a new environment.</p><p>&ldquo;Voltaire, the French philosopher, said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Dr. Calhoun. &ldquo;I wish I had heard this earlier in my life and career, because so many times we try to make things perfect and forget what tremendous &lsquo;good&rsquo; we are doing for our family, our friends, and our community. Recognize the value you provide, don&rsquo;t be too hard on yourself, and reward yourself with a few moments regularly for relaxation.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>5 more ways to put Mommy stress in its place</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Stay balanced</strong>. Keeping your heart, soul, mind and strength in balance allows you to be happy, healthy and content.</li><li><strong>Moderation is key</strong>.

As the table discussion was wrapping up at the Fire Administration Building in St. Augustine, Capt. Jeremy Robshaw asked Shank a question but didn&rsquo;t get a response.</p><p>Puzzled, Robshaw repeated the question.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought maybe the chief was just messing with him,&rdquo; said Jeff Prevatt, Shank&rsquo;s right-hand man and the assistant fire chief at the time.</p><p>&ldquo;I immediately turned and noticed the chief had his hand over his face. I&rsquo;ve known Carl for a long time and I knew that was unusual. As soon as he moved his hand down, I recognized the facial droop and a light bulb went off in my head. I said to myself, &lsquo;Jeff, this is real. The chief is having a stroke.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Within seconds, Shank was surrounded by his leadership team. One radioed for an ambulance. Another knelt down beside the stricken fire chief to assess the severity of the stroke. Prevatt began making calculations in his head, knowing time is of the essence when it comes to treating stroke.</p><p>&ldquo;We could tell Carl had had a serious stroke, and we knew we needed to send him to a comprehensive stroke center right away,&rdquo; said Prevatt, a 37-year firefighter. &ldquo;So we made the decision to send the chief to Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville&rsquo;s Stroke Center. And the fastest way to get him there was by helicopter.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Early warning sign</strong></p><p>This wasn&rsquo;t the first time Shank, who has a family history of stroke, had experienced a cardiovascular issue.</p><p>While competing in the 2017 Fight for Air Climb in downtown Jacksonville, Shank, 51, started experiencing symptoms of atrial fibrillation (AFib), an irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots, heart failure and stroke. The fit firefighter had completed the arduous, 42-floor ascent in years past, but had trouble catching his breath this time.</p><p>&ldquo;It took me forever to get to the top,&rdquo; said Shank. &ldquo;I really felt bad when it was all over.&rdquo;</p><p>The stairwell scare was Shank&rsquo;s wake-up call. He started working out more and watching what he ate. He even hired a personal trainer. He was being evaluated for AFib when he had a stroke at his office a week before Thanksgiving.</p><p><strong>A comprehensive stroke center makes all the difference</strong></p><p>Shank arrived at the Baptist Jacksonville ER with limited movement on his right side and severe speech impairment. A CAT scan confirmed that he had suffered an ischemic stroke caused by a blood clot clogging a main brain vessel. Within minutes, he received an intravenous medication called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to help dissolve the clot and reverse the negative effects of a stroke.</p><div class=\"u-size2of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1525357202/Juice/legrandphoto--0981secondary.jpg\" alt=\"doctors work to treat a stroke patient\"></div><p>Less than 20 minutes later, Shank underwent an emergency surgical procedure to remove the clot. The procedure, known as a thrombectomy, was performed in the specially equipped neurosurgical OR suite by endovascular neurosurgeon Ricardo Hanel, MD, PhD, co-director of the Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center at Baptist Jacksonville.</p><p>Dr. Hanel used a special device called a stent retriever to remove the clot by making a small incision in the groin and then passing a micro-catheter into the blocked vessel. The minimally invasive procedure took only 25 minutes.</p><p>&ldquo;Carl regained all of his strength on the right side after the clot was removed,&rdquo; said Shank&rsquo;s wife, Julie, a nurse practitioner and a former ER nurse at Baptist Jacksonville. &ldquo;I could tell he recognized me and our two children when we got to his room in the Neurointensive Care Unit. He couldn&rsquo;t talk to us, so we just held hands.&rdquo;</p><p>Two days later, Shank was discharged from the hospital and started on medication to help prevent future clots associated with atrial fibrillation.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing to look at the timeline now,&rdquo; said Shank, who arrived at the Baptist ER at 4:51 pm and was out of the operating room by 6:05 pm. &ldquo;After the procedure, I immediately felt better, but I still couldn&rsquo;t talk. It took me a week before I could say my wife&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p><p>Shank was discharged with expressive aphasia a speech impairment that occurs in about 12 percent of stroke cases.</p><p>&ldquo;He has a speech deficit, but it&rsquo;s nowhere near what it could have been had he not been transported to a Comprehensive Stroke Center like the one at Baptist that treats the most complex stroke cases,&rdquo; said Prevatt, who was appointed St. Johns County&rsquo;s interim fire chief in December. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s made a remarkable recovery. But had he not gone to Baptist, the outcome may not have been the same.&rdquo;</p><p>Baptist Jacksonville is one of only seven hospitals in Florida to be certified as a Comprehensive Stroke Center by The Joint Commission and the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association. To be eligible, hospitals must have advanced imaging capabilities, 24/7 availability of specialized treatments, and provide physician assistants, nurses and other staff with unique education and training to care for complex stroke patients.</p><p>&ldquo;Our goal is to provide the best stroke care in the country right here in Jacksonville, and we do that through excellent patient care, research and education&rdquo; said Dr. Hanel, director of the Baptist Neurological Institute. &ldquo;Chief Shank had a terrible stroke, but due to rapid assessment by Emergency Medical Services personnel, he was transported to the appropriate stroke center by the fastest means necessary. Any delay on his care would have changed this happy-ending story.&rdquo;</p><p>Even before the helicopter carrying her husband of 26 years touched down at Baptist Jacksonville&rsquo;s landing pad, Julie Shank said she received a call from Dr. Hanel. &ldquo;He wanted to reassure me that his team would take very good care of Carl,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The support I received at Baptist was phenomenal. There was someone with me the whole time Carl was in surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;And we couldn&rsquo;t be more thankful to St. Johns County Fire and Rescue for getting Carl to the hospital in such a timely manner,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s here today because of them.&rdquo;</p>",

Smoking is highly associated with breast cancer, especially among younger, pre-menopausal women.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t drink too much.</strong> How much is too much?

Obese post-menopausal women have a 20 &ndash; 40 percent higher risk than those who are at a healthy BMI.</li><li><strong>Y</strong><strong>ou knew it was coming &ndash; eating right is important for a cancer-free future</strong>. Try to stick to a plant-focused diet, lean meats and complex carbs, and limit your sugar intake. If it&rsquo;s too hard to follow this type of diet every single day, stick to it during the week and allow yourself some leeway on the weekends.</li><li><strong>Estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy may increase your breast cancer risk when used for more than two years. </strong>Talk to your doctor if you are considering this therapy.</li><li><strong>Take control of your breast health by having an <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/mammography-and-bone-density-scan\" target=\"_blank\">annual mammogram</a> starting at age 40 (earlier if you have a family history) and performing monthly self-breast exams</strong>.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>After a long holiday weekend, James Jeunelot hit the gym for a tough morning workout. As he went through his routine, he noticed some pain in his right shoulder while bench pressing. At 43 and in good shape, he ignored the pain and kept going, determined to reach his goal.</p><p>&ldquo;All of a sudden, I started sweating bullets,&rdquo; Jeunelot said. &ldquo;But I thought it was just from the workout.&rdquo; By the third set, he had severe chest pain, so he cut the workout short and drove home. After showering and getting dressed, he was still perspiring heavily and had pain on his right side.</p><p>&ldquo;I could tell something wasn&rsquo;t right with James,&rdquo; his wife Crystal said. &ldquo;I googled his symptoms &mdash; profuse sweating, chest and shoulder pain &mdash; and the results kept bringing up heart attack. Even though he didn&rsquo;t have all the symptoms, I knew something was wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeunelot wanted to go to work, but Crystal got him to agree to check his blood pressure first. &ldquo;It was 160 over 110. At that point, it was clear to both of us that he needed to get to <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-south\">Baptist Medical Center South&nbsp;</a>as soon as possible,&rdquo; Crystal said.</p><p>The couple didn&rsquo;t know it at the time, but Jeunelot was experiencing the &ldquo;widow maker,&rdquo; so called because a blockage of the heart&rsquo;s main artery is typically fatal if not treated immediately.</p><p>Baptist South&rsquo;s ER, like all of the Baptist Health hospitals, is nationally accredited as a Chest Pain Center, which means the patient will receive rapid cardiac diagnosis and intervention in the event of a heart attack.</p><p>&ldquo;In what seemed like about 30 seconds, I was already in an exam room with the medical team surrounding me,&rdquo; Jeunelot said. An electrocardiogram revealed he had a 100 percent blockage in his left coronary artery, so he was rushed to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab for an emergency balloon angioplasty (surgical repair of an artery) and a stent to keep the artery open.</p><p>&ldquo;We were able to do this procedure in a minimally invasive way,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-bharat-gummadi-md\" target=\"_blank\">Bharat Gummadi, MD,</a> said. In the Cath Lab, the physican threads a small catheter through an artery in the arm or groin to treat blockages in heart vessels.</p><p>Dr. Gummadi performed the angioplasty just 41 minutes after Jeunelot arrived at the emergency room. The American Heart Association&rsquo;s recommended guideline is 90 minutes.</p><p>Jeunelot returned home just three days after his heart attack. He has modified his diet to one that is low in fat and salt, and now takes medication to regulate his blood pressure and cholesterol. His good habits are making a difference; three years after his heart attack, he still has a clean bill of health.</p><p>&ldquo;I never would have expected this at my age,&rdquo; Jeunelot said. &ldquo;I was never a big fan of doctors, but I am now. I see Dr. Gummadi regularly, and listen to what he says. Even if you&rsquo;re young, know your numbers and do what it takes to get them in a good range.&rdquo;</p>",

The white nurse&rsquo;s cap, a holdover from her days as a graduate nurse at Prince George&rsquo;s Hospital outside Washington, D.C., sits on a pedestal of textbooks atop a file cabinet.</p><p>Back when Marlett went to nursing school, a nurse&rsquo;s cap was a mandatory part of the uniform. The caps went out of fashion in the 1980s, but once a year, during National Nurses Week, she wears the cap proudly while making her nursing rounds at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;Everybody looks at me three times,&rdquo; said Marlett, who also sports an all-while nursing uniform during Nurses Week. &ldquo;The patients always say, &lsquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s a real nurse.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p><p>A nurse was all Marlett ever wanted to be. The Maryland native spent two years as a medical assistant before enrolling at Prince George&rsquo;s, an acute care teaching hospital just outside the nation&rsquo;s capital. For $50 a year in 1972, aspiring nurses received free uniforms, lunch and bus fare.</p><p>&ldquo;We spent half the day in class and the other half in the hospital,&rdquo; recalled Marlett, now in her 45th year in nursing. &ldquo;Everyone in my class graduated and we all passed our boards on the first try.&rdquo;</p><p>Marlett worked at Prince George&rsquo;s for 18 years, including three in pediatrics. She&rsquo;s spent the bulk of her career in critical care, including a 20-year stint as a nurse manager of an emergency room, before coming to Baptist Jacksonville in 2008 as nurse manager of endoscopy, the examination of the inside of the body using special instruments. She was recently named associate director of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-heart-hospital\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Hospital</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;Leaving the ER was one of the hardest decisions I ever made, but sometimes you feel like it&rsquo;s time for a change,&rdquo; said Marlett, the daughter of a World War II Army medic. &ldquo;My question to myself was &lsquo;Why did you become a nurse?&rsquo; And the answer was to take care of patients.&rsquo; &rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>A black-and-white photo of Marlett from her days at Prince George&rsquo;s hangs on a wall in her office. In the photo, Marlett is standing at the foot of a patient&rsquo;s bed, charting on a small table. She&rsquo;s wearing a short white dress and a &ldquo;cupcake-style&rdquo; nurse&rsquo;s cap, the kind made famous at New York&rsquo;s Bellevue Hospital, the first training school for nurses in the U.S. The photo says a lot about Marlett: a throwback to the days when nurses wore all white and proudly sported distinctive caps and nursing school pins on their uniforms.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go to nursing school because I wanted a job, I went because I wanted to be a nurse,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;And I was going to do whatever it took to become one. Nursing isn&rsquo;t what I do. It&rsquo;s who I am.&rdquo;</p>",

But his time in Iraq is a constant reminder not to take medical care &ndash; in any setting &ndash; for granted.</p><p>A former staff physician at a Navy hospital in Naples, Italy, and the department head of a Navy primary care clinic in Groton, Conn., Dr. McQuade was the medical director of public health at Naval Hospital Jacksonville before he joined Baptist Primary Care in 2016. His wife, a Navy nurse, was about to give birth to their third child when he was deployed to Iraq 12 years ago.</p><p>He spent seven months as the triage officer at Fallujah Surgical, a makeshift trauma facility in central Iraq. The medical team there had just weathered the Battle of Fallujah, one of the bloodiest engagements of the war.</p><p>&ldquo;They had seen enormous casualties. They told us we would never see any more wounded. But it got busy right away,&rdquo; said Dr. McQuade, a retired Navy captain and a 1979 Naval Academy graduate who helped treat nearly 3,000 patients, including more than 600 surgical emergencies, at Fallujah Surgical.</p><p>Part of Dr. McQuade&rsquo;s job was to keep &ldquo;a perfect inventory&rdquo; of every patient who came through the doors, whether it was a U.S. Marine or an enemy insurgent. &ldquo;All you have to do is never lose track of who is in the building,&rdquo; a predecessor advised.</p><p>Four months into his tour of duty, a suicide bomber drove a vehicle into a truckload of female Marines. Three of the Marines died and 10 others were wounded. Dr. McQuade called the incident one of the worst days of his tour at Fallujah Surgical.</p><p><strong>Always be ready</strong></p><p>A wall in Dr. McQuade&rsquo;s office is plastered with colorful racing bibs commemorating his many running exploits, including distance events like the Marine Corps Marathon.</p><p>In his last week in Iraq, Dr. McQuade and a fellow physician ran a total of 75 miles in and around the Marine Corps compound.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Running provided the necessary mental break we used to survive in a world where you were on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week,&rdquo; Dr. McQuade added. &ldquo;An ER doc who cared for thousands of Marines during the Battle of Fallujah, told me, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ever give up running here, no matter how busy you get.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p><p>Those chaotic days are never far from the modest family doctor&rsquo;s mind. Writing a memoir of his time in Iraq was a cathartic experience.</p><p>&ldquo;I learned a lot being on call 24 hours a day in the desert,&rdquo; Dr. McQuade said. &ldquo;The concept of being always ready for more and never knowing when more may come, remains in my nature now.&rdquo;</p>",

To date, nearly 100 team members have graduated from Baptist&rsquo;s CNA prep course, which helps reduce a shortage of qualified CNAs across the health system.</p><p>&ldquo;The CNA program gave me an opportunity to get my foot back in the door. And the icing on the cake was that I got to stay in my same department,&rdquo; added Ross, who works rotating shifts in the ER.</p><p>Juan Allen graduated from Baptist&rsquo;s fifth CNA training class in 2016 and is now a CNA on the pediatric oncology and hematology unit at <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org\">Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital</a>. Prior to that, he worked as a UV technician at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>. &nbsp;&ldquo;When I heard that Baptist was offering a free CNA prep course, I wanted in,&rdquo; said Allen, a father of four. &nbsp;&ldquo;I left my Environmental Services job to work with patients at the bedside. I love making a great first impression with them.&rdquo;</p><p><br></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Xavier Javier had been competing in Taekwondo, an intense martial arts sport, for three years when he realized he didn&rsquo;t feel like his usual self.</p><p>&ldquo;I started having trouble with my breathing and felt heaviness in my chest,&rdquo; Javier said. &ldquo;I was getting tired doing basic chores, like mowing the lawn. My doctor thought I had asthma.&rdquo; He was given inhalers and herbal medications, but nothing changed.</p><p>Javier was determined to keep competing in Taekwondo. Not only was it a sport he enjoyed doing with his 13-year-old son, his dedication and training had earned him a 1st Degree Black Belt, the No. 6 ranking in the world for weapons and a No. 1 ranking in Florida for forms and weapons.</p><p>Then the unthinkable happened. He had just finished competing in combat sparring in a Georgia tournament when he began to feel extremely tired after exiting the ring.</p><p>&ldquo;That was the day I died,&rdquo; Javier said. His heart had stopped beating. Fortunately, there were paramedics on site who were able to shock his heart back to life using a defibrillator. He was then rushed to a Georgia hospital where he spent 11 days and received two stents. He had suffered severe blockages in the heart&rsquo;s major arteries.</p><p>Once Javier returned home to Ponte Vedra, Fla., his journey back to health would be challenging. He contracted pneumonia the same day he was discharged from the hospital and spent several days at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-south\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center South</a>. Once he was finally cleared to begin his rehabilitation, he enrolled in Baptist South&rsquo;s new Cardiac Rehabilitation Program.</p><p>The center helps patients who have suffered heart attacks and other cardiac events get back to their normal lives through physical activity, lifestyle modification, education, nutritional guidance and supervised exercise. During workouts, patients are hooked up to monitors to make sure their blood pressure, heart rhythm and heart rate are in a good range.</p><p>&ldquo;When I first started the program, I could only run on the treadmill for about a minute, but every time I went, the staff worked with me to increase the duration and intensity,&rdquo; said Javier. By the time he finished the 36-session program, he was able to run comfortably at a much higher intensity for longer periods of time.</p><p>&ldquo;The program provides patients with the reassurance they need to challenge themselves. Most people are extremely anxious to begin exercising after a heart attack,&rdquo; said Julie Fonger, coordinator of Cardiac Rehab and an exercise physiologist.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a terrifying experience being in such good shape and then going to zero,&rdquo; said Javier. &ldquo;But I felt comfortable pushing myself because I knew they had my back. If anything were to happen, the staff would know exactly what to do.&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone who works at Baptist Health Cardiac Rehabilitation Centers has Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) training.</p><p>Being just 37, in excellent physical shape and eating a clean diet, Javier didn&rsquo;t have any of the classic signs of heart disease. However, he does have a family history. &ldquo;All of my uncles died of heart attacks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had a cousin who died at age 27. So it&rsquo;s really in my blood.&rdquo;</p><p>Javier now takes heart medication and tries to be even better about his diet, eating less sodium and fewer sweets.</p><p>Taekwondo season starts this summer and he hopes to compete again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite back to the same level,&rdquo; said Javier, who now is able to train three times a week. &ldquo;I have really come a long way. The Cardiac Rehab program gave me the confidence to push myself.&rdquo;</p><p>For more information about Baptist South&#39;s Cardiac Rehabilitation Center, call 904.271-6325.</p><p><br></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>When you first enter parenthood, you think you have all the answers. It only takes one fitful night with a newborn to realize you had no idea. And once you do get a hang of one phase, time insists on marching onward and upward and on grows your newborn&mdash;now a toddler with a whole new set of challenges you have no idea how to handle.</p><p>Where once a newborn lay, a preschooler now runs, with his or her own ideas and identity and opinions. Parents across the country find themselves butting heads with their once-so-complacent child and asking themselves, &ldquo;Is this bad behavior?&rdquo;</p><p>This is a question that <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-devon-patterson-phd\">De&rsquo;Von Patterson, PhD,</a> a clinical psychologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a> at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-clay-medical-campus\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Clay Medical Campus</a>, is asked all the time.</p><p>&ldquo;Parents often have a misperception in terms of managing a child&rsquo;s behavior,&rdquo; said Dr. Patterson. &ldquo;There are two things to remember. One, nobody does something for no reason, and there&rsquo;s always a purpose, whether they are conscious of it or not. And two, nobody does anything in a vacuum; it&rsquo;s a learned behavior.&rdquo;</p><p>Take this common scene, for example. It&rsquo;s nearing lunchtime and you need your child to transition from playing to the table. You tell your toddler that it&rsquo;s time for lunch, but they continue to play with their toys. Frustrated, you ask your child to please be good, but they still refuse. Are they ignoring you? Are they being purposefully willful? Should you just let them continue to play for a few more minutes and then eat lunch? Should you bargain with your toddler?<br><br>&ldquo;Something that parents often say is that their child should listen to them &lsquo;because I say so.&rsquo; A child is more likely to do something when they are given clear expectations,&rdquo; Dr. Patterson explained.</p><p>The above scene could easily turn into a tantrum or a power struggle if not handled the correct way. &ldquo;The pitfall is that you want them to do something, but they don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; said Dr. Patterson. &ldquo;You need to be specific. When you say &lsquo;Be good,&rsquo; that can mean anything. Label your expectations in specific terms: &lsquo;Please put down your toy and come to the table,&rsquo; for example.&rdquo;</p><p>Bargaining isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, either. Once you have defined expectations, you can give your child options. For example, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for lunch. Do you want to eat in the kitchen or the dining room? Once we finish, we can come back to play time.&rdquo; You have given your child a choice about where to eat, and let him or her know play can continue after lunch.</p><p>Paying attention to your own reaction during these trials is also important. Do you find yourself getting worked up and angry? Keeping yourself calm and in control will help to keep your child calm and in control. Tantrums and power struggles are par for the parenting course, but given the right tools, they don&rsquo;t have to end in hurt feelings or relationships.</p>",

No judgment, really.</p><p>So, let us just get our obligatory health stuff over and done with quickly: regardless of your age, exercise provides benefits that are hard to ignore &mdash; better sleep, more energy, a stress reliever and even improved mental health.</p><p>Luckily, here in Jacksonville, we have a valuable resource to help keep us active: the outdoors! The city sits along the banks of the St. Johns River and has one of the largest urban park systems in the nation.</p><p>But, the best part is our experts at Baptist Health know a couple fun alternatives to the gym that get you out to those parks and help you hit your daily step goal.</p><p><strong>Plogging: For when you want to exercise and help Mother Earth</strong></p><p>First, the Swedes taught us the importance of living hyggely (think cozy) &mdash; and now they&rsquo;ve invented plogging, a new Scandinavian fitness trend to solve a problem you might not have given much notice to.</p><p>A mash-up of the words &ldquo;jogging&rdquo; and the Swedish phrase &ldquo;plocka upp,&rdquo; or &ldquo;pick up,&rdquo; plogging is a pretty simple concept: while you exercise, collect any trash you see along the way.</p><p>Plogging got its start in Sweden in 2016 when groups formed around this eco-friendly activity. The story goes that the founder of plogging started to notice a lot more litter on his streets than in years past and decided to do something about it.</p><p>Now, the exercise is sweeping the streets (and the sidewalks and the coastlines and the parks) in countries across the world.</p><p>In theory, plogging increases calorie burn during your run because you&rsquo;ll also be squatting down to grab trash off the ground. And you can add on the fact that plogging requires you to hold the squat until all the litter is collected, benefiting the hamstrings, calves and quadriceps.</p><p>According to a Swedish fitness app, Lifesum, a half-hour of jogging combined with trash pickup will burn 288 calories compared to the 235 burned by jogging alone. A brisk walk, in contrast, burns between 90 and 150 calories.</p><p>But, the benefits to the environment are priceless. During a time when climate change continuously tops the headlines, this exercise helps your body and the planet.</p><p><strong>Forest Bathing: Clothing optional? We think not.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As it turns out, this doesn&rsquo;t involve any bathing in the woods.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"u-size1of2 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1523477780/Juice/GettyImages-464723723_2.jpg\" alt=\"woman walks through a field\"></div><p>Forest bathing also doesn&#39;t require huge expanses to be effective, according to research conducted by an expert in forest medicine. Walks in the park, and aromatherapy focused on the use of cypress and other tree oils and even house plants provide some benefit.</p><p>Forest bathing reduces stress, anxiety, depression and anger. You can see an improvement in sleep, a boost of the immune system and better heart health, said Michael Mayotte, a senior wellness coach with the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/y-healthy-living-centers\">Baptist Y Healthy Living Centers</a>.</p><p>The general goal of forest bathing is to slow down and allow the natural environment to envelop you, allowing your body to focus on the smells, textures and sights of nature. As you declutter your brain, take deep breaths, close your eyes, forest bathing begins to take on a meditation feel.&nbsp;</p><p>The practice began in the early 1990s after the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries coined the term Shinrin-yoku &mdash; which translates roughly to forest bathing. Studies show that walking in a forest environment leads to more significant reductions in blood pressure and stress hormones than an equally strenuous walk through a city.</p><p>And for a little at-home cheat, diffusing essential tree oils at home can increase energy levels by more than 30 percent, Mayotte said. Aromatherapy enthusiasts know that tree oils, like pine and cypress, conjure a general state of well-being, capturing the essence of forest bathing within the home.</p><p><strong>Ultimate Frisbee: A college staple and&hellip; interval training</strong></p><p>Played either indoors or outside, Ultimate (known by many as ultimate Frisbee) combines the non-stop movement of soccer, rules of basketball and the overall objective of football, Mayotte said. Primary goal: get the Frisbee to the end zone and score a point for your team.</p><p>Since Ultimate was invented by high school students in the 1960s, it has grown to be considered an internationally competitive sport.</p><p>The American Council on Exercise says Ultimate burns an average of 477 calories per match and produces training benefits similar to those observed with moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise, such as running five miles per hour.</p><p>The data from American Council on Exercise show cardiovascular benefits are comparable to traditional interval workouts, as those playing Ultimate Frisbee tend to regularly switch from full sprints to jogging.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It is an excellent way to get the heart rate up, all while having fun,&rdquo; Mayotte said.</p><p><br></p><p><em>If you are concerned about your health and wellness, signed up for <a href=\"https://hlc.ezonlineregistration.net/\" target=\"_blank\">a free wellness coaching session </a>at the Baptist Y Healthy Living Centers.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>It&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t live without, but too much can lead to a host of chronic diseases.</p><p>Inflammation is your body&rsquo;s response to an infection or injury. It shows up as heat, pain, redness or swelling. It also can lead to a fever and swollen glands when you&rsquo;re sick. Inflammation comes to the rescue with white blood cells and platelets to help us heal.</p><p>When you&rsquo;re anxious or afraid, inflammation is also your body&rsquo;s response to help you escape a life-threatening situation. After you experience an injury or illness, inflammation is supposed to go away, but sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;When it builds up, it leads to inflamed cells that cause blockage, rupture and damage to healthy cells and tissue,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-mona-shah-md\">Mona Shah, MD,</a> a <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\">Baptist Heart Specialists </a>cardiologist certified in holistic medicine. Dr. Shah&rsquo;s mission is to educate patients on the connection between a healthy lifestyle and heart health, but her advice can help with a multitude of illnesses.</p><p>&ldquo;Chronic inflammation is at the root of almost every chronic disease,&rdquo; Dr. Shah said. &ldquo;And unfortunately, it goes unnoticed most of the time.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a smoldering fire building up inside our bodies.&rdquo;</p><p>The list of conditions that have inflammation as a common denominator goes on and on &ndash; from heart disease to cancer, stroke and arthritis to depression, fibromyalgia, migraines and neurological diseases.</p><p>&ldquo;When you consider that half of all adults have one chronic condition and that seven out of 10 patients die due to chronic diseases, it&rsquo;s clear that taking anti-inflammatory measures can save your life,&rdquo; said Dr. Shah.</p><p>Dr. Shah&rsquo;s No. 1 piece of advice is to eat healthy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in going on &lsquo;diets&rsquo; because those are usually short-lived. It&rsquo;s more about adopting a healthy lifestyle you can live with.&rdquo;</p><p>A good place to start, she said, is to follow the Mediterranean eating plan at least 80 percent of the time. &ldquo;The most common cause of inflammation is what you eat,&rdquo; she said.</p><div class=\"u-size1of1 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Mediterranean Diet Pyramid\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1522247522/Juice/Mediterranean_Diet_infographicJuice.jpg\"></div><p>The biggest culprits are &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; simple carbs and sugar. Dr. Shah recommends sticking to whole grains, like quinoa (pronounced &ldquo;keen-wa&rdquo;), brown rice and sweet potatoes. Healthy fats, like avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil are on the good list, too.</p><p>Avoid most saturated fats, such as cream, cheese and butter. Some saturated fats &ndash; like coconut oil, pure grass-fed butter, and even eggs &ndash; are OK in small amounts.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to stay away from trans-fats, especially anything with hydrogenated oil, like vegetable, corn or soy bean oil,&rdquo; said Dr. Shah. &ldquo;Take a look at food labels and avoid anything containing partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, which causes inflammation.&rdquo;</p><p>Eat meats that are free-range and organic to steer clear of hormones and other chemicals. Wild fish rather than farmed is one of Dr. Shah&rsquo;s recommendations, as is having some vegetarian days where you stay away from animal protein altogether.</p><p>Dr. Shah also encourages patients to take anti-inflammatory supplements, including magnesium, garlic, green tea and turmeric. Coenzyme Q10 (coq10), a powerful antioxidant that fights free radicals in the body&rsquo;s cells, is also high on her list. You can get it from food, such as grass-fed beef or chicken, broccoli, cauliflower, pistachio nuts and sesame seeds, or take it as a supplement. Ask your doctor about the right supplement dosages for you.</p><p>Dr. Shah has witnessed many patients who&rsquo;ve greatly improved their health by adopting a healthier eating lifestyle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen decreases in cholesterol and blood pressure, improvements in heart health, and weight loss. The best part is that patients report feeling much better.&rdquo;</p><p>To learn more about eating a healthy diet to lower inflammation, read Dr. Shah&rsquo;s blog at <a href=\"http://drmonashah.wordpress.com.\">drmonashah.wordpress.com.</a></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Nurse Jessica Hamm remembers the first time she laid eyes on the 14-month-old girl admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.org\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a> with horrific injuries.</p><p>Suffering from a skull fracture, brain bleed, broken femur and fractured wrists, malnourished and with a fresh handprint-shaped pattern of bruises on her little face, baby Delilah wasn&rsquo;t on the unit long before she was taken to emergency surgery to drain the fluids and pressure in her brain.</p><p>As a pediatric critical care nurse, Hamm sees kids who have suffered what are called &ldquo;non-accidental injuries&rdquo; far too often. Even she was shocked by the abuse heaped upon this fragile baby girl.</p><p>But on March 16, 2017, Hamm saw something else she didn&rsquo;t expect. Her future.</p><p>&ldquo;You know when you just know something, when you just have a feeling?&rdquo; asked Hamm. &ldquo;That day, I saw this beautiful child and I told my co-workers I was going to take her home.&rdquo;</p><p>She approached her colleague, Pediatric ICU social worker Jim Hutcheson, and asked him what she needed to do to make that happen. After 19 years in social work, Hutcheson had seen his share of pediatric caregivers consider giving an abandoned or abused child a home, but never taking the next step. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I asked her, &lsquo;Are you sure?&rsquo; and she said, &lsquo;Yes, I want to do this!&rsquo; She was persistent from the very beginning,&rdquo; Hutcheson said.</p><p>Since there was alleged abuse, Delilah&rsquo;s case had been taken up by the state Department of Children and Families (DCF). Hutcheson advised Hamm to call Family Support Services of Northeast Florida, which collaborates with DCF to find homes for abused and neglected children, so she could start the process of becoming a foster parent.</p><p>Hamm had been trying for years to have a biological child and had undergone multiple infertility treatments, but to no avail.</p><p>&ldquo;I went home and talked to my mom and my husband. Then I prayed about it,&rdquo; said Hamm. &ldquo;The next day, I called.&rdquo;</p><p>After a home investigation and a background check, DCF approved Hamm as a foster parent. She later renamed the toddler Delilah.</p><p>But Hamm was in for a surprise. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I found out that Delilah was a twin,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><strong>From one daughter to two</strong></p><p>Delilah&rsquo;s fraternal twin, now named Caroline, had been brought to the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s ER hours after her sister was admitted, but no one had yet made the connection between the two girls.</p><p>Caroline, though uninjured, had been taken to a different floor for X-rays, which revealed healing fractures. She, too, had been chronically abused.</p><p>Hamm didn&rsquo;t even hesitate. Without even meeting Caroline, she was ready to take both girls home as soon as they were discharged from the hospital.</p><p>During Delilah&rsquo;s month-long stay at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, her birth mother came for one last supervised visit. Hamm was there, too.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I would be filled with hate for her after what had happened to the girls, but when I met her, I just felt very sad for her,&rdquo; said Hamm. &ldquo;She had been fighting to keep the girls. That day, she saw how much I loved the girls and how well they were doing.</p><p>&ldquo;If she didn&rsquo;t do anything right as a mom before, she did this time. She signed the termination of parental rights that afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p>After a 30-day waiting period, Hamm&rsquo;s most fervent prayers came true. The adoption became final on Halloween, making her officially the twins&rsquo; mom. For the ceremony in Duval County Judge David Gooding&rsquo;s chambers, Hamm dressed her now-22-month-old daughter Caroline as peanut butter and Delilah as jelly.</p><p>Fittingly enough, Hamm&rsquo;s costume was bread, which holds PB &amp; J together perfectly.</p><p><strong>Together, forever</strong></p><p>Delilah still requires a brain MRI every couple of months to monitor her injury, and both girls are undergoing physical, occupational and speech therapies. They are thriving in Hamm&rsquo;s home, surrounded by love and attention. Hamm is looking forward to the holidays and many family firsts.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve grown by leaps and bounds since I got them. They&rsquo;re so smart and the sweetest, most beautiful kids ever,&rdquo; gushed the proud mom.</p><p>Hamm is grateful to her Wolfson Children&rsquo;s colleagues, family and friends, and even strangers, who came through for Delilah and Caroline, and their new mom, with support and generosity.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even have to ask. People brought the girls toys, clothes and furniture. One huge donation came from the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s ER team. Delilah and Caroline have touched everyone&rsquo;s lives who took care of them.&rdquo;</p><p>Her colleagues said they are thrilled for the new family. &ldquo;This kind of compassion is typical of people who take care of kids and who give of their bodies and minds to do that,&rdquo; said Virgil Saldajeno, MD, a University of Florida College of Medicine &ndash; &nbsp;Jacksonville pediatric critical care physician on the PICU.</p><p>&ldquo;To make the leap to do more than take care of their medical needs, it&rsquo;s just natural, and for one of our own to adopt a child is a really big deal. It&rsquo;s beautiful and amazing!&rdquo;</p><p>Hamm hopes that her story leads others to become foster or adoptive parents. &nbsp;&ldquo;My daughters are the blessing to me. I was meant to work here and meant to meet them, and they were meant to be mine.&rdquo;</p>",

Too much stress leads to bursts or leaks.</p><p>&ldquo;The same thing can happen to your body,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-patricia-calhoun-md\" target=\"_blank\">Patricia Calhoun, MD</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care</a> - San Jose family physician. &ldquo;There are downstream effects of high blood pressure that can occur as a result of poor management, and it tends to be more common than low blood pressure.&rdquo;</p><p>At least 50 to 70 percent of the patients <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-marcus-cox-md\" target=\"_blank\">Marcus Cox, MD</a>, sees on a daily basis suffer from high blood pressure. The <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a> cardiologist often warns the condition is a &ldquo;silent killer,&rdquo; increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke and renal failure.</p><div class=\"u-lg-size1of3 u-floatRight u-spaceLeft05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1523025338/Juice/GettyImages-159615067_crop.jpg\" alt=\"A girl with watermelon\"></div><p>If you&rsquo;re borderline hypertensive, you&rsquo;re unlikely to show any symptoms. But when your blood pressure becomes significantly elevated, you may start experiencing headaches, dizziness and blurred vision.</p><p>Though patients should follow their doctors&rsquo; recommendations, lifestyle changes can often help control or even reverse high blood pressure. &nbsp;Both Dr. Calhoun and Dr. Cox suggest their patients try to rein in potential issues with hypertension by adjusting diet and exercise routines before trying any medicine, if possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If patients can contribute on their end with some of these healthy modifications, their overall quality of life will be better than with just medication alone,&rdquo; Dr. Calhoun said.</p><p>Nearly one in three adults suffer from high blood pressure, a condition that can be helped with lifestyle changes. But what exactly does that mean for you?</p><p><strong>Eat this, not that&nbsp;</strong><br>Even a moderate reduction in daily salt intake can help reduce hypertension, said Dr. Calhoun. Most of our salt intake occurs when we eat out, and many people don&rsquo;t realize diet foods are often high in sodium. For example, diet salad dressings contain larger percentages of the daily salt recommendations.</p><p>Dr. Calhoun recommends the DASH diet &mdash;Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. The diet is high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, poultry, fish and nuts, and low in sweets, sugary beverages and red meats. As a result, it&rsquo;s rich in potassium, calcium, protein and fiber but contains limited saturated fats and cholesterol.</p><p>Combining the diet with a modest salt restriction can provide additional positives. &ldquo;Poor diet and lack of exercise always seem to be major factors so I try to approach this first,&rdquo; Dr. Cox said. &ldquo;Low salt is a must.&rdquo;</p><p>For daily coffee drinkers, Dr. Calhoun offers some good news: Caffeine does not impact blood pressure. It can speed up heart rate, but it doesn&rsquo;t cause hypertension.</p><p>After-work happy hours are another story. Women who consume two or more alcohol beverages per day and men who have three or more drinks per day have significantly increased incidence of hypertension compared to nondrinkers.</p><p><strong>These shoes are made for walking</strong><br>&ldquo;Exercising at least 30 minutes a day is also very important,&rdquo; Dr. Cox said. &ldquo;Diet and exercise go hand-in-hand, and it is practically impossible to have one without the other.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size1of2 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1523020127/Juice/hypertension1.jpg\" alt=\"A couple laughs as they walk outside\"></div><p>While exercise is important, those at risk for high blood pressure should not change their regimen until after being cleared by a physician.</p><p>In general, try to exercise at least three to four sessions per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. The American Heart Association recommends 150 minutes per week, which breaks down to about four, 40-minute sessions or five, 30-minute sessions.</p><p>&ldquo;I always ask, &lsquo;How much can you walk? Can you walk for five minutes a day? How about 10?&rsquo;&rdquo; Dr. Calhoun said. &ldquo;Every couple days add more time. Over 30 days, it gives my patients a challenge, and helps them make walking a habit.&rdquo;</p><p>Try to build up to 30 minutes each day.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to injure yourself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;As a runner, you aren&rsquo;t supposed to increase your mileage by more than 10 percent each week. Look at this the same way.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Be the star of your own &lsquo;The Biggest Loser&rsquo;</strong><br>Exercise aside, weight loss can contribute to a significant decrease in blood pressure for obese or overweight people.&nbsp;</p><p>For every pound lost, there is the possibility of seeing a corresponding decline in blood pressure. (Dr. Calhoun cautions that even skinny people can have high salt consumption and high blood pressure.)</p><p>Making the healthy choice isn&rsquo;t always the easy choice, but it&rsquo;s all a matter of habit, said Dr. Calhoun.</p><p>The American Heart Association recently adjusted the guidelines for high blood pressure, which means more people will be considered hypertensive. Patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease and other high-risk patients should be treated with medication if blood pressure is more than 130/80.</p><p>These new guidelines lowered the definition of blood pressure to account for complications that can occur at lower numbers than the previous guideline of 140/90.</p><p><em>If you need help controlling your blood pressure, or would like to find out more about how to prevent hypertension, visit <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care/request-appointment\" target=\"_blank\">baptistjax.com/bpc-appt</a> to find the right primary care doctor for you.</em></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Not all fats are created equal.</p><p>For years, popular diets told us to banish this four-letter word from our vocabulary &mdash; and our plates. But, studies show healthy fats can actually extend our lives by strengthening bone health, improving brain function and building a stronger immune system.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the United States Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines for Americans say fats are no longer dieting no-nos, but they do encourage replacing the saturated variety with healthy options. Even among celebrities and the wellness-savvy, high-fat, low-carb diets are trending. (Translation: Avocados. Lots of avocados.)</p><p>But, before you go off on an eating binge, remember all good things must come in moderation. Our Baptist Health nutritionists dish all the details.</p><p><strong>What is a healthy fat &ndash; and where do you find it?</strong></p><p>Ideally, you&rsquo;ll want to consume minimally processed foods that are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (say hello to your new BFF, Omega-3s) and monounsaturated fats, said Yvonne McCormick, a registered dietitian with Baptist Health Diabetes and Nutrition Resources.</p><p>Polyunsaturated fats, essential to bodily functions, come from food &mdash; healthy, delicious food! Sources of omega-3 fatty acids include walnuts, flaxseeds, canola oil and fish, such as salmon and sardines. Omega-6 fatty acids, linked to protection against heart disease, can be found in sunflower, soybean and corn oils. A word of caution: excessive consumption of omega-6 fatty acids may increase the probability of some diseases, such as heart attack and stroke.</p><p>Olive oil, which contains mainly monounsaturated fat, forms the basis of the Mediterranean Diet, often labeled the world&rsquo;s healthiest diet. Other than olive oil, monounsaturated fats can be found in avocados and most nuts, along with sunflower, canola and peanut oils.</p><p>To help incorporate these fats into your diet, try using &nbsp;monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats to replace saturated and trans-fats. But, healthy fats are only one component of a healthy diet, McCormick said. Their health benefits are optimized when consumed with the proper daily plant-focused diet that includes vegetables, fruits, whole grains and lean protein sources.</p><p><strong>What do fats do for our body?</strong></p><p>Fats should not be avoided, but we should understand that too much of the wrong types may put us at risk for heart disease or stroke, McCormick said.</p><p>Uses of fats within the body are wide-ranging: they provide a source of energy, protect our organs and form a part of every cell membrane in our body. They also help with hormone production and the absorption of many necessary vitamins. In babies, fats contribute to the development of the brain and central nervous system.</p><p>Contrary to what you might hear, healthy fats in the diet promote lower LDL cholesterol levels and maintain better HDL levels, reducing the risk of heart disease. Cholesterol, a waxy substance made by the liver, has two main forms &mdash; LDL and HDL. LDL is often referred to as the &ldquo;bad cholesterol,&rdquo; while HDL is often called &ldquo;the good cholesterol.&rdquo;</p><p>But the added perk of fats? They are filling. People end up eating less at each meal, which can help contribute to weight maintenance or loss.</p><p><strong>Which fats should I avoid?</strong></p><p>The worst kind of dietary fat is trans-fat, the byproduct of a process called hydrogenation that turns healthy oils into solids for a longer shelf life. To spot these fats on a nutrition label, look for &ldquo;partially hydrogenated oils&rdquo; in the ingredient list.</p><p>Trans-fats used to be found mainly in solid margarine and vegetable shortening, but now appear in everything from store-bought cookies to fast-food French fries.&nbsp;</p><p>Eating foods high in trans-fats does the opposite of healthy fats &mdash; increasing the amount of bad cholesterol and reducing the beneficial. They create inflammation, often linked to heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Even in small amounts, trans-fats increase the risk of chronic health conditions.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>We all have habits. Some are good (for example, brushing your teeth before bed), while others can be annoying or even harmful, such as biting your nails or mindlessly eating a pint of ice cream when you feel stressed. Individuals create habits by repeating certain behaviors until they become automatic. Habits free your brain to focus on more important decisions and activities.</p><p>All habits, good and bad, develop essentially the same way. There is a cue, or something that triggers a behavior, the routine (the behavior itself) and the reward, which is the most important part.</p><p>When a behavior triggers the brain&rsquo;s reward center, it releases dopamine, a feel-good neurotransmitter. This is why it&rsquo;s easy to develop bad habits. In the short term, the behavior makes you feel good. Over time, however, the bad behavior becomes hardwired into your brain, and then you can&rsquo;t easily stop doing it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to recognize when bad habits cross the line and become an addiction. Addictions aren&rsquo;t just about drugs and alcohol; people also become addicted to caffeine, gambling, anger, food, the internet, sex, work and nicotine. Addiction is a disease, just like heart disease. If left untreated, an addiction can disrupt your life, work and relationships and cause long-term physical effects. Fortunately, there are effective treatments for addictions.</p><p><strong>Breaking bad habits</strong></p><p>There is no one single best way to break bad habits; however, it is possible to break even the most deeply entrenched habits if you put your mind to it. Here are a few helpful tips for breaking bad habits.</p><ol><li><strong>Become mindful.&nbsp;</strong>If your goal is to quit smoking, for example, become aware of what&rsquo;s going on in your mind and body at the moment you smoke or experience the urge to smoke. Studies show that mindfulness can even help people quit smoking &mdash; one of the hardest habits to break.</li><li><strong>Practice self-control</strong>. You can build your self-control through practice. Start with something that&rsquo;s easy for you, and then once you&rsquo;ve mastered that behavior, move on to a more challenging behavior.</li><li><strong>Become a detective</strong>. By analyzing your habits, you can identify your triggers and substitute unwanted rewards with different ones.</li><li><strong>Make if-then plans</strong>. If you know you tend to engage in bad habits in certain situations, decide ahead of time what you will do instead the next time you face this challenge.</li><li><strong>Use an app</strong>. Google the bad habit you want to break (or a good habit you want to develop) and you&rsquo;ll probably find there&rsquo;s an app for that! An app can help you identify triggers and schedule the time you need to develop positive habits. Seeing your progress will keep you motivated to stay the course.</li></ol>",

It provides free car seat inspections by appointment Tuesday mornings at THE PLAYERS Center in Metro Square, along with monthly car seat inspections at Subaru of Jacksonville and periodic Booster Seat Saturdays. At every inspection site and at no cost to the family, a certified child passenger safety technician with Safe Kids Northeast Florida will check that child restraints are properly installed and that children are buckled in age- and size-appropriate car seats, booster seats, or seat belts. Then the technician will make sure the parent knows how to install the seat correctly.</p><p>&ldquo;Car seats can be complicated and the manuals that come with them can be hard to understand,&rdquo; said Danielle Kessenger of Safe Kids Northeast Florida, a local coalition led by THE PLAYERS Center. &ldquo;Nine out of 10 parents don&rsquo;t realize they are driving around with improperly installed car seats. It&rsquo;s important to learn how a properly installed car seat can prevent serious injuries in the event of a vehicle crash.&rdquo;</p><p>Kessenger, a certified child passenger safety tech since 2003 and a certified instructor with the National Child Passenger Safety Board since 2013, helped install a pair of brand-new car seats for Tabrielle Lee, a Jacksonville mother of three who was involved in a two-car crash 12 days before Christmas.</p><p>Lee, 25, was driving her 21-month-old twins to daycare when another motorist struck her vehicle on the driver&rsquo;s side. The force of the impact caused Lee&rsquo;s children to come out of their forward-facing car seats. Daughter Vanya landed on the floor behind the driver&rsquo;s seat. Son Kenton landed in his mother&rsquo;s lap.</p><p>After her vehicle stopped spinning, Lee pried herself out from under the front airbag and waited for help to arrive.</p><p>&ldquo;There was glass everywhere. Kenton&rsquo;s head was bleeding and his face was scratched up. Vanya was screaming, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if she was injured or not. Everything happened so fast,&rdquo; Lee said.</p><p>An ambulance arrived at the scene soon after the accident and whisked Lee and her twins to the emergency room at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/wolfson-childrens-hospital\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>, where it was determined that Vanya had a broken femur and a skull fracture, and Kenton had an orbital fracture along with glass particles in one eye.</p><p>&ldquo;It was really scary,&rdquo; said Lee, adding that her son underwent CT scans to rule out any head trauma. Once her kids were admitted to a medical/surgical unit at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, Lee checked herself into the adult ER at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>. &ldquo;My right ankle and heel were swollen, but my injuries were minor compared to theirs,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Vanya had emergency surgery at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s to repair her thighbone and was placed in a body cast for six weeks. After Vanya&rsquo;s cast was removed, Lee and her husband were invited to THE PLAYERS Center&rsquo;s headquarters at Metro Square to receive two brand-new car seats, courtesy of a grant from Graco and Safe Kids Worldwide, a global nonprofit working to help families and communities keep kids safe from injuries. The couple also received a number of basic car seat safety tips, including when to switch from rear-facing seats to forward-facing ones.</p><p>According to Kessenger, toddlers are more than five times safer riding in rear-facing car seats than forward-facing ones, and should remain in a rear-facing seat until they reach the top height or weight limit allowed by the seat manufacturer.</p><p>Rear-facing seats better support a child&rsquo;s head, neck and spine and will keep them 75 percent safer in a crash, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><p>Lee said she and her husband learned a lot of valuable information during their in-depth car seat inspection at THE PLAYERS Center, which was founded in 2011 with a naming gift from THE PLAYERS Championship to improve the health, wellness and quality of life of area families.</p><p>&ldquo;THE PLAYERS Center was very helpful,&rdquo; said Lee, who also has a six-month-old daughter named Kenley. &ldquo;Basically, you want to make sure your children are safe and secure in their seats because an accident can happen at any given moment.&rdquo;</p><p>To make an appointment at the Safe Kids Buckle Up&reg; Inspection Station, call 904.202.4302, or visit Wolfsonchildrens.org/safekids for more information.</p>",

But Victoria Leal, a registered nurse in the PCU/ICU at Baptist South, can think of no better way to spend her time.</p><p>Since 2011, Victoria has been to 13 countries with Operation Smile, transforming the faces of more than 2,000 babies born with cleft palates or cleft lips.</p><p>Worldwide, a child is born every three minutes with a cleft palate or cleft lip -- a birth defect causing a gap in the upper lip and roof of the mouth that doesn&rsquo;t close during the early stages of pregnancy. It can be caused by genetics, poor pre-natal nutrition or exposure to harmful environmental substances.</p><p>A cleft can be repaired in a 45-minute to 1 &frac12;-hour surgery. In the U.S., this procedure is common, but people in developing countries don&rsquo;t have the resources or health care system in place for this life-changing surgery.</p><p>Operation Smile, along with volunteers like Victoria, is helping reverse that trend.</p><p><strong>Hope for a normal life</strong></p><p>Babies born with cleft palates or cleft lips in small, impoverished villages often have no hope for a normal life. They become isolated, bullied, are typically severely underweight, and can&rsquo;t speak well.</p><p>Some families feel such shame about having a baby with a cleft lip or a cleft palate; they give the child away to a sympathetic relative or to an orphanage and abandon them. Operation Smile provides the medical staff, funds and resources to make the free corrective surgeries possible. Families will walk miles when they hear that Operation Smile will be visiting, Victoria said. &ldquo;We are the hope for these people.&rdquo;</p><p>The organization has been providing cleft lip and cleft palate surgery for children in need since 1982 by sending medical mission teams to places where there is no access to quality surgical care.</p><p>Victoria learned about Operation Smile when she was teaching a community Spanish class. A nurse in the class wanted to learn Spanish so she could go on an Operation Smile mission trip.</p><p>&ldquo;She told me that I should go too since I was already bilingual, but I told her I didn&rsquo;t have any experience with babies,&rdquo; said Victoria, who emigrated from Colombia in 2000. But she decided to apply anyway and left on her first mission trip to the Nicaragua just weeks later. She was hooked.</p><p>Victoria helps with pre-operative evaluations and post-operative care. &ldquo;During the first day of the trip, we screen hundreds of babies to see if they are healthy enough for the surgery,&rdquo; she explained.</p><p>The team continues to monitor children who aren&rsquo;t ready and gives their mothers nutritional guidance and healthy food in hopes they will be strong enough when the next mission group arrives.</p><p>The malnutrition is due to the opening in the roof of the mouth, which makes feeding extremely difficult. &ldquo;I once evaluated a 1-year-old who couldn&rsquo;t even walk yet,&rdquo; said Victoria.</p><p>The team has 60 to 70 clinicians, including nurses, physicians, plastic surgeons, dentists, anesthesiologists, pediatricians, OR technicians and a psychologist to help explain the procedure to the parents. Volunteers are from all over the world and speak different languages, but strict protocols make everything run smoothly.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like an orchestra,&rdquo; said Victoria &ldquo;We all know our part.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>12-hour days</strong></p><p>Upon arriving in a village, the Operation Smile team carries all the necessary equipment to the hospital to set up their make-shift OR. They perform 25 surgeries a day on average on five operating tables. During a recent week-long trip, 125 children had the surgery, Victoria said.</p><div class=\"u-size1of2 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Victoria Leal laughs with a patient\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1522243372/Juice/Mexico.jpg\"></div><p>The conditions are rough in the old government hospitals where the surgeries are performed. Resources are sparse and sometimes there isn&rsquo;t even air conditioning.</p><p>&ldquo;In some places, we don&rsquo;t even have poles to hang the IV bags on,&rdquo; said Victoria. &ldquo;Most of the time, the moms and babies are on mattresses on the floor during recovery. In Vietnam, we had two mothers and two babies each in a single bed. But they don&rsquo;t care about being uncomfortable. They are just grateful to have the surgery.&rdquo;</p><p>Like her shift at Baptist South, she works 7 pm to 7 am, but with no breaks. She works five 12-hour days straight, caring for 25 babies each night.</p><p>Not all are babies. Some are adults who have suffered with the condition their entire lives. On one of her trips, In Peru, doctors performed the surgery on a 57-year old man and a 52-year-old woman. Both cried when they saw their new reflection in the mirror.</p><p>&ldquo;The moms cry too when they see their babies after surgery,&rdquo; said Victoria. &ldquo;Many times they don&rsquo;t even recognize their own child.&rdquo;</p><p>As Victoria scrolls through her phone, showing off pictures of one beautiful baby after another, she beams with joy and then gets choked up.</p><p>&ldquo;People sometimes ask me why I volunteer. They wonder why I would use all my paid time off to travel to these types of places for no pay,&rdquo; said Victoria. &ldquo;I do it for my babies. I love my babies. Each one is special.&rdquo;</p><p>Victoria recognizes that her level of dedication isn&rsquo;t for everyone, but says that anyone can do something to help other people. &ldquo;Finding a way to use your skills outside of work can make a huge difference in the world.&rdquo;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Unless you&rsquo;re a teenage boy, eating all you want is probably not an option. But what if you&rsquo;re pregnant? Is eating for two OK?</p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, eating for two is a myth,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/obstetrician-and-gynecologist/dr-jeannine-mauney-md\">Jeannine Mauney, MD,</a> an OB/GYN who delivers at Baptist Medical Center South. &ldquo;I tell my patients that as long as they are eating a well-balanced, healthy diet with a daily prenatal vitamin, their baby will get the nutrients needed. You really don&rsquo;t need to eat more than usual.&rdquo;</p><p>But many pregnant women eat much more than they should. A new study from the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-weight-gain.htm\">Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;</a>says that nearly half of all American women gain more weight than they should during pregnancy. Many gain excessive amounts.</p><p>So what should the scale say? The recommendation is based on your body mass index (BMI). The standard weight gain should be between 25 and 35 pounds; if you&rsquo;re underweight, the recommendation is 28 to 40 pounds. And if you&rsquo;re overweight, you may need to gain only 15 to 25 pounds.</p><p>&ldquo;I see some patients &ndash; even those who start out at a normal weight &ndash; gain 50 pounds or more during the course of their pregnancy. This is not healthy and can cause a multitude of problems, including a lifetime of weight issues for the mother,&rdquo; Dr. Mauney said.</p><p>In addition to eating a well-balanced diet, Dr. Mauney encourages her patients to incorporate exercise as a part of their daily routine. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to start a new high-intensity activity while you&rsquo;re pregnant, but it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to start a low-impact exercise like walking,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Gaining too much weight can also cause serious health conditions.</p><p>&ldquo;Gestational diabetes is more prevalent among women who gain more weight than they should,&rdquo; Dr. Mauney said. A recent study by the American Diabetes Association shows that high maternal weight is associated with a substantially higher risk of gestational diabetes.</p><p>Gestational diabetes occurs when the placenta makes hormones that can increase the amount of sugar in the blood. If your pancreas can&rsquo;t keep up with the demand to make more insulin, your blood sugars rise, causing the condition.</p><p>&ldquo;Babies born to moms with gestational diabetes may have higher birth weights, making the delivery more difficult and increasing the likelihood of a C-section and even birth trauma,&rdquo; Dr. Mauney said. The condition can be treated during pregnancy but there is a much higher risk of the mother developing type 2 diabetes later in life.</p><p>Excessive weight gain also can increase the risk of preeclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein in urine, which can cause serious complications for mother and baby. The condition can sometimes be treated with IV or oral medications, but the ultimate cure is to deliver the baby, which can be an issue if it&rsquo;s too early.</p><p>The best game plan? Work on a healthy diet and exercise before you get pregnant.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re thinking about getting pregnant, schedule a preconception consultation with your OB/GYN so you can make healthy lifestyle changes before you get pregnant,&rdquo; Dr. Mauney said. &ldquo;The more healthy habits you have in place, the better &ndash; for you and the baby.&rdquo;</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Armed with a host of time-honored family recipes from her native country, Mai Pham went out on a limb and opened Lemon Grass, the first Vietnamese and Thai restaurant in Sacramento, Calif.</p><p>The year was 1989, and Pham (pronounced Fam) had a hard time finding the necessary ingredients to make such traditional Vietnamese dishes as &ldquo;shaking&rdquo; beef, chicken satay and braised catfish in a clay pot.</p><p>&ldquo;There was a Safeway supermarket next door, so we talked them into ordering lemon grass, but they didn&rsquo;t know that the most valuable part is the bottom, not the top, and they kept throwing the bottom part away,&rdquo; recalled Pham in a phone interview.</p><p>&ldquo;No one could understand what I was doing. Customers would come in and ask for sweet and sour sauce. It was two years before they stopped asking for bread.&rdquo;</p><p>Luckily, the former TV journalist and one-time gubernatorial speechwriter found a small farmer south of town who agreed to grow the aromatic herbs she desperately needed to keep her one-of-a-kind restaurant as authentic as possible.</p><p>&ldquo;And to this day, he still provides the restaurant with herbs,&rdquo; added Pham, a former keynote speaker at the annual <a href=\"https://www.wjct.org/events/a-day-4her/\" target=\"_blank\">A Day 4Her&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/4her-center-for-women\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a>in Jacksonville, a one-day event sponsored by <a href=\"http://Baptistjax.com\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health&nbsp;</a>and WJCT Public Broadcasting.</p><p>Chef, cookbook author, food columnist, and Food Network contributor, Pham gave up a promising journalism career to follow her passion for Southeast Asian cuisine. To open Lemon Grass, Pham leaned on recipes passed down from her mother and grandmother.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing was written out. I did it all from memory,&rdquo; said Pham, who fled South Vietnam in 1975 with her family.</p><p>&ldquo;When we first came to America, there was nobody here to help us. We lived in someone&rsquo;s basement and were given $200 from the Red Cross.&rdquo;</p><p>Pham remembers her parents riding a city bus to attend English classes in Washington, D.C. Her father, a former Vietnamese diplomat stationed in Thailand, lost everything when South Vietnam fell, including his government job and the family&rsquo;s dream house.</p><p>&ldquo;We came here with just the clothes on our back. We lost everything overnight. I always point to my parents and our personal story as the motivation that steered me toward what I&rsquo;m doing today,&rdquo; added Pham, who attended an American school in Bangkok, and co-hosted a public affairs radio show on Armed Forces Vietnam Network when she was only 16.</p><p>That experience heavily influenced Pham&rsquo;s decision to pursue a career in journalism in the United States. After attending the University of Maryland on a full scholarship, she landed her first TV reporter job with an NBC affiliate in Albuquerque.</p><p>&ldquo;When I arrived there, all the other stations came to do a story on me as the first Vietnamese-born TV reporter in the country,&rdquo; Pham recalled. &ldquo;Then I got recruited to work at a CBS station in Sacramento, which led me to writing speeches for then-California Governor George Deukmejian.&rdquo;</p><p>Pham said her milestone moment as a political speechwriter came in 1988 when Deukmejian delivered a speech she wrote for the dedication of California&rsquo;s Vietnam Memorial. A year later, she left politics to start her niche restaurant in the state capitol.</p><p>&ldquo;Vietnamese is not a cuisine where you take a lot of spices and ingredients and cook them for a long time. We are a quick-cook style of cuisine,&rdquo; added Pham. &ldquo;My husband calls it the &lsquo;Tuscany of Asia&rsquo; because the food is very natural, very simple and easy to understand.&rdquo;</p><p>Pham said Vietnamese cuisine &ldquo;is all about fresh herbs and different sauces.&rdquo; A popular dipping sauce, known as Nuoc Cham, consists of fish sauce, garlic, vinegar and lime. &ldquo;You sprinkle it on like a vinaigrette,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not thick or creamy. That&rsquo;s the Vietnamese way. Everything is very light, simple and aromatic.&rdquo;</p><p>Pham never aspired to be a celebrity chef or a restaurateur when she attended college in the early 1980s on a Scripps Howard journalism scholarship. But cooking was always a way to share her heritage with others - one meal at a time.</p><p>&ldquo;It allows me to weave my background into my work and make Vietnam a talking point,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Years ago, I never saw this happening. I didn&rsquo;t connect the dots. But running a restaurant teaches you a lot about life. I feel gratified that people are interested and curious about Vietnamese food, its flavors and its culture, and they want to make it part of their lives.&rdquo;</p>",

He has since retired from the profession.</p><p>&ldquo;For a while, he couldn&rsquo;t read or remember what he read, but his mind is so active and his aphasia is getting better all the time,&rdquo; added Carl Jr., who accompanies his father to speech therapy sessions. &ldquo;If Baptist Medical Center had not stayed opened through the hurricane, my dad would not be alive today.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Or you worry about your child if he&rsquo;s late coming home from school. You&rsquo;re wringing your hands about how you&rsquo;re going to come up with the money for that major car repair.</p><p>A little anxiety can be beneficial. It&rsquo;ll push you to do the things you need to do, such as completing work tasks. But excessive fretting and worrying is clearly bad for your health.</p><p>&ldquo;Too much anxiety can impact our ability to concentrate, function and remember things,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/psychologist/dr-devon-patterson-phd\" target=\"_blank\">De&rsquo;Von Patterson, PhD</a>, a psychologist with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health</a> on the Baptist Clay Medical Campus.</p><p>Dr. Patterson and Cortney D. Surrency, ACE, a wellness coach with Riverside <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/y-healthy-living-centers\" target=\"_blank\">Y Healthy Living Center</a>, offer these tips to help you manage your anxiety.</p><ol><li><strong>Do it/go anyway</strong>. Anxiety can make us avoid social interactions, family events or work. &ldquo;Unfortunately, avoidance strengthens our thoughts, fears and anxious responses to people and situations,&rdquo; Dr. Patterson said. &ldquo;Do it or go anyway &ndash; even if it&#39;s for a short duration. Go or do it for a few minutes, if necessary. Over time, you can gradually increase your tolerance.&rdquo;<br><br></li><li><strong>Make a list of what helps</strong>. Anxiety often hinders our ability to think clearly. Having an accessible list on paper or in your phone can reduce the effort it takes to subdue anxiety when it occurs. &ldquo;Managing anxiety is personal,&rdquo; Dr. Patterson said. &ldquo;If someone has helped you feel better in the past, talk to that person again,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;If something has helped in the past, do more of it.&rdquo;<br><br></li><li><strong>What could go right?</strong> Anxiety can lead to catastrophic thinking about everything that could go wrong. &ldquo;For each worry about something that could go wrong, generate two other things that could happen,&rdquo; Dr. Patterson said. &ldquo;Perhaps I am worried people will think my new haircut looks bad. I might consider the possibility that people might love it, people might not care, or people might not even notice.&rdquo;<br><br></li><li><strong>Use positive self-talk</strong>. Negative-self talk is the foundation of anxiety, preventing you from doing what you want to do. Surrency said, &ldquo;You can end up spending too much time on the unknown and not focused on the right now.&rdquo; She advises using coping statements, such as &ldquo;I will overcome how I feel&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stronger than this anxiety&rdquo; to help you move forward.<br><br></li><li><strong>Sleep and exercise make everything better</strong>. &nbsp;&ldquo;Prioritizing and attempting to troubleshoot sleep problems can be a significant step in the right direction to symptom management,&rdquo; said Dr. Patterson. &ldquo;Was there ever a time when you slept well or slightly better than other times? What was different? What did you do? What did you NOT do?&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re not exercising a lot, start small, he recommended. &ldquo;Big behavior changes are difficult to sustain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go to the gym once a week if that&#39;s where you are. Go once per month if that&#39;s where you are. Build from there.&rdquo;<br><br></li><li><strong>Mindful being</strong>. Mindfulness has been associated with reducing anxiety. &ldquo;There are many ways to be more mindful,&rdquo; Dr. Patterson said. &ldquo;Any activity that focuses your attention to the present moment can be a form of mindfulness (i.e., yoga). Identifying colors around you, background noises or other observations can also help focus your attention to the present moment.&rdquo;<br><br></li><li><strong>Do something fun and purposeful</strong>. Anxiety can cause unhealthy spikes in a stress hormone called cortisol, which is known as our &ldquo;fight-or-flight hormone.&rdquo; High levels of cortisol can cause weight gain and even inhibit the body from fighting off infection and healing. Surrency said, &ldquo;Doing something fun or doing for others can decrease anxiety and help you feel more connected. Try writing down four things you would like to do for yourself and four things you would like to do for someone else.&rdquo;<br><br></li><li><strong>Learn your behavioral cues</strong>. Behaviors are more easily identified than how we&#39;re feeling. Ask yourself, Dr. Patterson said, &ldquo;When I feel anxious, what do I notice? How would someone else looking at me know I am anxious? Perhaps you put things down forcefully, or stop talking to people around you, or you speak too loudly or too softly.&rdquo; Learning your behavioral cues can improve your awareness of self and provide a path to alleviate negative emotions or anxiety. An example: &quot;When I begin putting things down forcefully, it means that I&#39;m feeling overwhelmed. When I feel overwhelmed, going for a walk tends to help.&rdquo;<br><br></li><li><strong>Just breathe</strong>. &ldquo;Deep breathing can activate the body&rsquo;s relaxation response,&rdquo; Surrency said. &ldquo;Taking a few diaphragmatic breaths can help reduce anxiety immediately. Try slowly inhaling to a count of four, filling your belly first and then your chest, gently holding your breath to a count of four, and slowly exhaling to a count of four and repeat several times. Your body will begin to relax and you will begin to have an increased feeling of calm.<br><br></li><li><strong>Set boundaries</strong>. We want to be there for our family and friends but we often forget to take time for ourselves. If we&rsquo;re not careful, our &ldquo;rope&rdquo; will run thin. &ldquo;Learning to lovingly say &lsquo;no&rsquo; or &lsquo;I need to think about it&rsquo; can decrease your anxiety over time,&rdquo; Surrency said. &ldquo;You will feel less obligated to do for others and find more time for yourself!&rdquo;<br><br>Of course, not all anxiety can be managed alone. If you&rsquo;re feeling overwhelmed, talk to your doctor. Your symptoms could be a sign of an anxiety disorder that can be treated.</li></ol>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Last August, when hospitals in the Houston area were severely impacted by Hurricane Harvey, medical air transport companies from around the country were called to provide crucial air medical support, including pediatric patient transfers.</p><p>Two members of the <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/programs-services/hospital-services/Pages/kids-kare.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Kids Kare&nbsp;</a>Pediatric Transport team at <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital&nbsp;</a>volunteered to help transport sick children to and from Houston-area hospitals.</p><p>The duo, Nicole Lanier, a pediatric critical care nurse, and Pete Mrgich, a pediatric respiratory therapist, flew to Texas in Air Life 12, a single-engine plane that periodically flies pediatric patients who are too critical to be transferred by the Kids Kare Mobile ICU or the Life Flight helicopter to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;Our hospital administrators said &lsquo;Do what you have to do, and we will cover your shifts here. They didn&rsquo;t ask any questions. They just said &lsquo;go,&rsquo; &rdquo; said Lanier, who along with Mrgich spent more than a week in Texas, operating out of airports in Grand Prairie and College Station.</p><p>The pair arrived at Grand Prairie Municipal Airport near Dallas on Sunday, Aug. 27, two days after Harvey made landfall near Corpus Christi as a Category 4 hurricane. Their first mission was to transport two NICU babies from a Houston hospital that had all but exhausted its hurricane supplies.</p><p>During their eight days in Texas, Lanier and Mrgich transported patients by air and by ground ambulance and were often one of the few pediatric transfer teams in their staging areas. Mrgich said each mission could last up to six or seven hours. &ldquo;You would circle an airport, land and refuel and then wait for your turn to take off again,&rdquo; he recalled. Lanier said the air traffic was very high and what they saw on the ground often broke their hearts. &ldquo;When we flew to Beaumont, Texas, we saw houses covered in water right up to the rooftops.&rdquo;</p><p>Lanier, a former Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Newborn Intensive Care Unit nurse, has been with the Kids Kare team for more than five years. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great feeling to be able to help the families of sick children. You are taking care of their most precious possessions,&rdquo; said Lanier. &ldquo;Some of the hospitals in Texas are not blessed with the resources we have here at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s.

Since 1997, she has been a member of a federal disaster medical assistance team that volunteers to deploy to hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters.</p><p>In Puerto Rico, Ketchie commanded a 35-member medical team that spent nearly three weeks helping the people of the island. Her tour of duty included a stint at a 70-bed federal medical station in the coastal town of Manati, approximately 50 miles west of the capital city of San Juan.</p><p>Set up in an indoor sports arena, the medical station served as both a shelter and an urgent care clinic for citizens who had difficulty being seen at area hospitals but still needed around-the-clock care. &ldquo;There was no electricity outside the arena and we had people who required electricity to run their breathing machines,&rdquo; added Ketchie, a registered nurse for more than 25 years. &ldquo;Some of the patients even required hospice care. Our goal was to keep them as comfortable as possible and treat all their medical needs.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in the national disaster system since 1997 and it&rsquo;s so important to give recognition to Baptist Health for allowing me to keep helping people in their time of need.&rdquo;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>If you ask the mother of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatric-cardiologist/dr-shawyntee-mayo-md\" target=\"_blank\">Shawyntee Mayo, MD,</a> she will tell you she always knew that her daughter would become a doctor. Herself a pediatric psychiatric nurse in New York City, Dr. Mayo&#39;s mother worked with her fair share of doctors and knew what it would take for her own little girl to grow up and fill those shoes. She knew her daughter was made of the same stuff.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until Dr. Mayo began her residency at Duke University Medical Center that she knew the field to which she would inevitably dedicate her life. Inspired by her mentor, Brenda Armstrong, MD, the second female African American pediatric cardiologist, Dr. Mayo began her path to becoming a pediatric preventive cardiologist.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s an amazing woman,&rdquo; said Dr. Mayo. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure which field I was going to end up in, but then I met Dr. Armstrong and I knew I wanted to be in pediatric preventive cardiology.&rdquo;</p><p>It might come as a surprise that the field of preventive cardiology even exists for the pediatric population. Why do the young ones in America need this sort of care in the first place? Whether it&rsquo;s because of lack of knowledge or simply the lack of resources, many children today are leading unhealthy lifestyles that result in obesity, high cholesterol and other complications that you don&rsquo;t think of presenting themselves until one has reached adulthood.</p><p>Childhood obesity certainly is not a new epidemic, but it is at an all-time high. Currently, it is estimated that one in five children and adolescents (or 12.5 million) ages 2&ndash;19 years old are obese. Obesity is associated with serious health risks, particularly those associated with the heart. High blood pressure, coronary heart disease and high cholesterol are just some of the ways that obesity can affect the health of children today and even more so when they become adults.</p><p>While lifestyle choices are one of the key factors that can lead to obesity and high cholesterol levels, an individual doesn&rsquo;t have to be obese to have high readings. Certain genetic factors and disorders can lead to unhealthy cholesterol levels. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder that leads to aggressive and premature cardiovascular disease. For those with FH, although diet and lifestyle are important, they are not the cause of high cholesterol. In these patients, genetic mutations make the liver incapable of removing excess cholesterol.</p><p>Dr. Mayo, previously with Children&rsquo;s Medical Center Dallas, is now with <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.org/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a> and is also an assistant professor with the <a href=\"https://hscj.ufl.edu/medicine/\" target=\"_blank\">University Of Florida College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville</a>. She serves alongside other nationally renowned pediatric cardiologists, electrophysiologists and cardiovascular surgeons at <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.org/centers-of-distinction/heart/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Terry Heart Center&nbsp;</a>at Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospital, as well as the physicians at the <a href=\"https://ufhealthjax.org/location/46/uf-health-pediatric-multispecialty-center-prudential-drive/\" target=\"_blank\">UF Pediatric Weight Management Center</a>. She says the childhood obesity epidemic has made it more important than ever for children to be screened for risk factors of adult heart disease, and Dr. Mayo and her colleagues are committed to serve the children in Northeast Florida, Southeast Georgia and well beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so much more than just identifying the risk,&rdquo; explained Dr. Mayo. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about teaching a whole new lifestyle and supporting the entire family in that lifestyle change&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Mayo and the physicians, psychologists, dietitians and staff in the Pediatric Weight Management Center offer a family-centered and team-based approach to their care. A mother to a toddler, Dr. Mayo can empathize with the parents accompanying their child in the exam room.</p><p>&ldquo;I have never met a parent who didn&rsquo;t want what was best for their child,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They are here because they know their child needs our help, and I support and applaud that. As a parent, it isn&rsquo;t always easy to ask for help. Once I became a mother, I had a new appreciation for what they might be feeling during that first appointment.&rdquo;</p>",

The health of your brain, like the health of your body, can get a boost from eating the right foods.</p><p>Go ahead. Have some piece(s) of mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Blueberries and grapes.</strong> A Tufts University study suggested that blueberries can delay memory loss. You can also eat fruits that are dark red and purple (grapes), which contain the same protective compounds, called anthocyanins. They are also rich in polyphenols, which have antioxidant properties that can protect your brain.</li><li><strong>Beans and chickpeas.</strong> They have vitamin B, magnesium, and protein &ndash; ingredients that help your body make healthy red blood cells and healthy neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters are how your brain cells talk to each other. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Green leafy vegetables.</strong> From swiss chard to spinach, dark leafy greens can boost your brain health. Mix them with broccoli and other vegetables to add color, flavor and more brain-protecting antioxidants.</li><li><strong>Sweet potatoes.</strong>&nbsp; Their beautiful color comes from beta carotene, which your body converts to vitamin A. This vitamin helped study participants improve their verbal memory and perform better in cognitive tests. Sweet potatoes also contain anthocyanins -- antioxidants that can protect your brain. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Healthy fats.</strong> The goal is to avoid trans fats and add more oily fish. Good fats, like essential fatty acids and omega-3 in oily fish build brain cells, reduce brain inflammation and can improve your mood and memory. (They also protect your heart.) However, they are not made by our bodies; we get them from oily fish like salmon, trout, mackerel and sardines. Plant sources are flaxseed, soy beans, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds and walnuts.<br><br></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Remember: what is good for your heart is also good for your brain. Reducing your risk of heart disease can also reduce your risk of stroke and protect the health of your brain.</p><p>A high intake of fruits and vegetables has been shown to have a beneficial cascade effect. What&rsquo;s a high intake? Eat five to nine servings (1/2 cup fruit or vegetables or 1 cup leafy greens) daily. The higher your fruit and veggies intake, the lower your risk. Aim for fruits and vegetables that are high in folic acid, potassium and antioxidants.</p><p>For maximum benefit, limit sodium and alcohol. Also, consider boosting potassium: It can lessen the effects of sodium on blood pressure. The best source of potassium is food, such as fruits and vegetables, rather than supplements.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>If you&rsquo;re a parent, you know all about the &ldquo;terrible twos.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;ve probably witnessed a few: epic temper tantrums and complete meltdowns in grocery store aisles, parks and other very public places.</p><p>The odds of a toddler having a temper tantrum are about the same as that of the sun rising in the morning. But with the sun, at least you know when it&rsquo;s going to happen.</p><p>Actually, tantrums are somewhat predictable because they usually occur when toddlers get frustrated due to hunger, being tired, bored, not being understood or not getting their way. What&rsquo;s worse, the terrible twos come upon just as toddlers are starting to gain skills in mobility, dexterity and communication. Many act out as a way of exerting their independence and dissatisfaction when their wishes aren&rsquo;t immediately addressed.</p><p>As they start walking and exploring their environment, toddlers gain a feeling of being more in control. A little freedom can go to anyone&rsquo;s head, and in the case of a 2-year-old, it often leads to a power struggle with mom and dad.</p><p>&ldquo;Tantrums are the result of a normal developmental process, and usually start as early as 1 year old and can last until about age 4,&rdquo; said Terrie Andrews, PhD, a pediatric psychologist and administrator of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/behavioral-health\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Behavioral Health&nbsp;</a>and <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.org\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;There is no common sense in general for toddlers,&rdquo; said local pediatrician Thomas Connolly, MD, past president of the Northeast Florida Pediatric Society. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &lsquo;see it and do it!&rsquo; You&rsquo;ll notice an increase in tantrums when a child&rsquo;s limited communications skills make it difficult for others to understand his or her wishes.</p><p>&ldquo;When an adult doesn&rsquo;t respond to what the child is requesting, the child throws a tantrum or gets more physical in an attempt to get his or her demands met. As your toddler&rsquo;s vocabulary improves, tantrum intensity will usually decrease.&rdquo;</p><p>So what&rsquo;s a parent to do? Do you always stand your ground? Do you compromise? Do you discipline?</p><p>The best thing to do in most tantrums is ignore them, quickly check the environment for safety, then leave,&rdquo; said Dr. Connolly. &ldquo;Let them &lsquo;break dance&rsquo; on the floor while you walk away. Once they&rsquo;ve lost your attention, the tantrum will usually fade as the child becomes curious about where you are and what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p><p>Once a child understands basic counting, he added, you can start using the 1-2-3 warning system. But when you hit 3, you&rsquo;ve got to follow through with a consequence.</p><p>A good rule of thumb for time-out length is a minute for every year of the child&rsquo;s age. Find a place like a stool in the corner or the bottom stair for the child&rsquo;s time to be served. A time-out shouldn&rsquo;t be fun, so sending your child to his room where toys and games are accessible won&rsquo;t be effective. Also, the bedroom is a sanctuary for sleep, so avoid making it a destination for punishment, he said.</p><p>When it comes to what you as a parent can do to reduce the incidence of tantrums, there are a few things to keep in mind. For instance, be careful how you phrase a request.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask children to do something when they must do what you&rsquo;re asking,&rdquo; Dr. Andrews recommended. &ldquo;For example, don&rsquo;t ask, &lsquo;Would you like to eat now?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s time for dinner, so come and sit down at the table.&rsquo; Pushing back and testing limits are part of their development, but it is how you manage the situation that makes the difference in how they learn from that event.&rdquo;</p><p>Also, giving your child some control is not entirely a bad thing. For example, offering two choices for snack time or phrasing things in a way that lets them choose between two things can accomplish this: &ldquo;Do you want a snack before or after your nap?&rdquo;</p><p>Positive attention and reinforcement also helps, as well as staying in tune with your toddler&rsquo;s sleep and eating schedule so she doesn&rsquo;t get overtired or hungry. Understanding a toddler&rsquo;s development is helpful, and creating routines and structure are, too.</p><p>At what point, then, do you know if your toddler&rsquo;s defiant behavior becomes an issue that needs assessment and intervention from a professional?</p><p>&ldquo;If the tantrums get more and more intense, it takes hours for a child to calm down and reset, the frequency of the tantrums is increasing, or family life becomes severely affected, I&rsquo;d recommend seeking the help of your child&rsquo;s pediatrician or a pediatric psychologist,&rdquo; said Dr. Connolly.</p><p>&ldquo;When most kids get upset, they usually move on after 10 minutes to something else fun to do. Issues with hearing, the possibility of an autism spectrum disorder, underlying anxiety or fears about something, or if there&rsquo;s abuse: these are all conditions to consider as the foundation of this type of behavior and you should reach out for help.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Tips for handling a control-hungry toddler</strong></p><ul><li>Remain calm and do not argue with the child.</li><li>Try to intervene before he is out of control. Get down at the child&rsquo;s eye level and say, &ldquo;You are starting to get revved up. Slow down.&rdquo; Now you have several choices of intervention.</li><li>Positively distract the child by getting her focused on something else that is an acceptable activity.</li><li>Once the child calms down, give him the attention he desires.</li><li>Most importantly, talk with your child once she has calmed down. After the crying stops, discuss the problem, try to help solve it and introduce some coping skills for future situations.</li></ul><p><br></p>",

While driving in the car with his fianc&eacute;, he&rsquo;d ask her where she lived &ndash; and she&rsquo;d calmly reply, &ldquo;With you, of course.&rdquo; Or, as Martin took his step son to school, he&rsquo;d ask, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the salt and pepper shaker?&rdquo;</p><p>Recognizing his family&rsquo;s confusion at the strange comments, Martin still remembers how he felt in those moments. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re an idiot. Why do you keep asking these stupid questions?&rdquo; he&rsquo;d ask himself.</p><p>Despite his declining health, Martin married on May 20 and drove to Orlando with his wife to celebrate what should have been one of their happiest moments.</p><p>Orlando, however, was a turning point in his disease&rsquo;s progression.</p><p>At the hotel, Martin attempted to climb into the pool, but could hardly stand. He stumbled from person to person, using young swimmers as support.</p><p>People complained he was too drunk, but his wife told them, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not drunk. He&rsquo;s sick.&rdquo;</p><p>The two left Orlando and on May 25, Martin was admitted into the Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville Emergency Center. That&rsquo;s when things suddenly started to make sense.</p><p>Doctors performed an emergency craniotomy to diagnose Martin, and the biopsy confirmed he had central nervous system lymphoma.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, we could put a name to it, and the name was cancer,&rdquo; Martin said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone takes that term lightly.&rdquo;</p><p>By the time his diagnosis came back, Martin was dying. His white blood cell count was astronomical, and his fever spiked to 106 degrees. At one point, confused and fevered, Martin ripped out his IVs, his catheter, and even the staples on his head.</p><p>Dr. Cavaliere recommended a high dose of chemotherapy.</p><p>&ldquo;We were so desperate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a high dose, but we were so desperate that first day because he was progressively getting worse and worse.&rdquo;</p><p>For six days, Martin remained in a coma. His family and friends &ndash; all knowing his diagnosis even before Martin did &ndash; waited to see the chemo&rsquo;s results. As it turned out, Martin&rsquo;s body handled the chemo very well &ndash; and has continued to do so in the seven rounds he&rsquo;s had since.</p><p><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Travis Martin conga line\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/q_35/v1514484594/Juice/img_0525.jpg\"></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a true save,&rdquo; Dr. Cavaliere said. &ldquo;The guy came in comatose, and now he&rsquo;s normal. It&rsquo;s a delightful outcome.&rdquo;</p><p>Katie Pearsall, one of Martin&rsquo;s best friends, founded the Live for Today Foundation, which helps young adults with cancer. The organization assisted Martin and his family. When he woke up from his coma, Pearsall was there. The foundation ultimately helped Martin return a normalcy to his life by sharing experiences about his cancer with other survivors.</p><p>&ldquo;I never thought at 32 I&rsquo;d be diagnosed with stage IV brain cancer, which is pretty bad from what I hear,&rdquo; Martin said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m here today so I&rsquo;m pretty happy about it. I&rsquo;m just going to keep on living and laughing and making other people laugh too.&rdquo;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Children&rsquo;s hospitals are nothing new to Morgan Strickland&rsquo;s little boy Jack. The spunky 3-year-old, who was born premature, spent nearly four months in a neonatal intensive care unit after birth, and another month and a half in a pediatric intensive care unit, or PICU, with aspiration pneumonia, a lung infection that develops when food, liquid or vomit is inhaled into the lungs.</p><p>&ldquo;We were pretty much in and out of hospitals the first six months of his life,&rdquo; said Strickland. &ldquo;He was a micro preemie. He weighed only 1.8 pounds at birth.&rdquo;</p><p>Strickland thought her son was free and clear of children&rsquo;s hospitals after the pair moved to Florida in May 2017. A week after they settled in Pensacola, where Strickland works as an emergency room nurse at Sacred Heart Hospital, the unthinkable happened: Jack developed a sinus infection that escalated into a life-threatening aneurysm, an enlargement of an artery. He spent June 3, 2017, his third birthday, in a Pensacola hospital with one eye swollen shut and his body full of antibiotics.</p><p>&ldquo;We were in the hospital for nine days trying to figure out why he wasn&rsquo;t getting any better,&rdquo; recalled Strickland, who slept at the hospital every night, even after working her 12-hour shift in the ER.</p><p>Joshua Dixon, MD, an otolaryngologist (ENT) affiliated with Sacred Heart, performed sinus surgery on Jack, and then ordered an MRI of his neck. The scan revealed an aneurysm in one of Jack&rsquo;s carotid arteries.</p><p>After a second MRI, Jack was flown to <a href=\"http://Wolfsonchildrens.org\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital&nbsp;</a>in Jacksonville on a special plane equipped to handle critically ill pediatric and neonatal patients. The flight crew included a pediatric critical care nurse and pediatric respiratory therapist with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Kids Kare Mobile ICU team.</p><p>&ldquo;It still had not occurred to me how truly sick he was,&rdquo; said Strickland, who met pediatric neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatric-neurosurgeon/dr-philipp-aldana-md\" target=\"_blank\">Phillip Aldana, MD</a>, upon arrival at the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s PICU. &ldquo;But everyone was very calm about the situation, so it didn&rsquo;t stress me out too much.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Aldana, co-medical director of the <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/centers-of-distinction/neuroscience/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Stys Neuroscience Institute&nbsp;</a>at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, told Strickland the sinus infection had caused a weakening in the walls of Jack&rsquo;s carotid artery. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very rare to see something like that, and very difficult to diagnosis,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>The following day, Jack was seen by both Dr. Aldana and endovascular neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-eric-sauvageau-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Sauvageau, MD</a>, co-director of the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center&nbsp;</a>at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>. &ldquo;Dr. Sauvageau came in and we discussed some options, including cutting the carotid artery out or putting a stent in,&rdquo; Strickland recalled. &ldquo;And I remember saying, &lsquo;If this was your baby on the table, what would you do?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p><p>According to Dr. Sauvageau, getting rid of the artery was the safest way to treat Jack&rsquo;s complex condition. &ldquo;Fortunately, his body created an alternate natural bypass from another artery to bring blood to this area,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>Strickland said her son&rsquo;s endovascular surgery was the longest three hours of her life. &ldquo;Dr. Sauvageau said he was going to save my baby, not the vessel, and that&rsquo;s what he did. I will respect him forever for that,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Today, Jackson is as rambunctious as ever, bouncing off living room furniture and asking his mother a million questions.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s pretty much a normal 3-year-old,&rdquo; said Strickland. &ldquo;We may or may not need surgery in the future, but given the circumstances, we will deal with it.&rdquo;</p>",

While these tests can be used to diagnose the most serious illnesses and injuries in children, they also are great tools for checking for the minor injuries kids are prone to, from broken bones to soft tissue injuries.</p><p>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital follows an &ldquo;Image Gently&rdquo; pledge, which means pediatric specialists are committed to using the smallest dose of radiation possible to get the information they need to make decisions about treatment.</p><p>Most X-rays and CT scanners have the ability to adjust dosage by entering the patient&rsquo;s weight.

As a pediatric radiologist and as a parent, knowing the dosing was adjusted for his size put Dr. McGraw more at ease.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s reassuring as a parent to know that the CT scanner at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s is calibrated with children in mind so it delivers the lowest dose of radiation possible while still yielding a high quality, diagnostic study,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When it comes to radiation dose, we realize that less is more, and I work diligently to produce an examination that is of diagnostic quality, yet delivers the lowest dose of radiation that is reasonably achievable.&rdquo;</p><p>Added Scott: &ldquo;Children aren&rsquo;t little adults. They have unique medical needs.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Life gets crazy sometimes. We don&rsquo;t always have time for the gym. If your routine got sidelined by time constraints or an injury, the good news is you can still get back on track.</p><p>Your heart muscle and cardio fitness can start diminishing in a short period of inactivity &ndash; but they&rsquo;re also quick to build back up. So, where do you pick up again?</p><p>&ldquo;You can start with a moderate workout three times per week,&rdquo; says <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-carlos-zamora-md\" target=\"_blank\">Carlos Zamora, MD</a>, a cardiologist at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Heart Specialists</a> with a focus on sports cardiology.</p><p>As examples, Dr. Zamora says running, brisk walking, bicycling, playing basketball, dancing, and swimming are moderate aerobic activities. Aerobic activity makes your heart beat more rapidly to meet the demands of the body&#39;s movement. Over time, regular aerobic activity makes your heart and cardiovascular system stronger and fitter.</p><p><strong>How often do I need to exercise?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Aerobic activity can be spread throughout the week. Exercising at least 3 days a week may help to reduce the risk of injury and avoid excessive fatigue.</p><p>&ldquo;Both moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes. Episodes of this duration are known to improve cardiovascular fitness and some risk factors for heart disease and type 2 diabetes,&rdquo; Dr. Zamora explains.</p><p>When you do the equivalent of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week (30 minutes five days a week), the benefits include lower risk of premature death, coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and depression.</p><p>As you increase from 150 minutes a week toward 300 minutes (5 hours) a week, you gain additional benefits: lower risk of colon and breast cancer and prevention of unhealthy weight gain.</p><p>&ldquo;For example, a person who exercises for 300 minutes (5 hours) a week has an even lower risk of heart disease or diabetes than a person who does 150 minutes a week,&rdquo; Dr. Zamora says.</p><p><strong>How hard do I need to exercise?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The guidelines for adults focus on two levels of intensity: moderate-intensity activity and vigorous&ndash;intensity activity. To meet the guidelines, you can do either moderate-intensity or vigorous-intensity aerobic activities, or a combination of both.</p><p>It takes less time to get the same benefit from vigorous-intensity activities as from moderate-intensity activities. A general rule of thumb is that 2 minutes of moderate-intensity activity counts the same as 1 minute of vigorous-intensity activity.</p><p>&ldquo;Thirty minutes of brisk walking is roughly the same as 15 minutes of running,&rdquo; says Dr. Zamora.</p><p>Here are his examples for moderate intensity exercise:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Walking briskly, 3 mph or faster, but not race-walking</li><li>Water aerobics</li><li>Bicycling, slower than 10 mph</li><li>Playing tennis (doubles)</li><li>Ballroom dancing</li><li>General gardening</li></ul><p>Ready to take it up a notch? Here are examples of vigorous intensity:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Racewalking, jogging, running</li><li>Swimming laps</li><li>Playing tennis (singles)</li><li>Aerobic dancing</li><li>Bicycling 10 mph or faster</li><li>Jumping rope</li><li>Hiking up the hill or with a heavy backpack</li></ul><p>&ldquo;Think of exercise as medicine,&rdquo; Dr. Zamora says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a prescription that has unlimited refills and puts you in charge of your health.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Carlos Zamora, MD, FACC, is a cardiologist with Baptist Heart Specialists who focuses on helping others avoid heart disease. Prior to moving to Jacksonville, he was assistant professor at the Columbia University Division of Cardiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami.

The Indiana resident couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of going back to his 40-acre farm without his wife of nearly 60 years by his side.</p><p>Days earlier, the Yoders were driving back to the &ldquo;Hoosier State&rdquo; from their vacation home in Sarasota, Fla., when tragedy struck near the Florida-Georgia line. Ray had just asked Wilma to pull over so they could switch seats when he got the shock of his life.</p><p>&ldquo;We were going down the ramp to the welcome center when she quickly brought the car to a stop. I looked over and said, &lsquo;Oh, my goodness, mom. What happened?&rsquo; But there was no response,&rdquo; Ray recalled.</p><p>Wilma had suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm. She arrived at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville in a comatose state with an extensive brain bleed, according to neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-eric-sauvageau-md\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Sauvageau, MD</a>, co-medical director of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist&rsquo;s Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center.</a></p><p>To remedy the life-threatening situation, Dr. Sauvageau performed a minimally invasive procedure to slow the flow of blood into the aneurysm, allowing the diseased vessel to heal on its own.</p><p>But for two days after the endovascular procedure, Wilma lay motionless in a hospital bed on the 10th floor of the Weaver Tower. Her prognosis wasn&rsquo;t good. Ray said he was just biding his time until he &ldquo;closed the lid&rdquo; on her casket.</p><p>&ldquo;With the kind of brain bleed she had, the odds were initially not in her favor,&rdquo; Dr. Sauvageau added.</p><p>Then out of the corner of his eye, Ray saw a glimmer of hope as he sat in the neuro ICU room: Wilma lifted an arm off the bed. &ldquo;My brother-in-law, who was sitting on the couch with me, said, &lsquo;Did you see that?&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;Yes, I did.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p><p>Wilma would spend five weeks at Baptist Jacksonville and another nine weeks in rehab before returning home. Ray wondered if she would ever be healthy enough to travel to Florida again. &ldquo;Dr. Sauvageau said age goes against you in a situation like hers. But we were lucky we were close to one of the best neurology places in the country when this happened,&rdquo; Ray said.</p><div class=\"u-size1of2 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1522266427/Juice/Ontheroad.jpg\" alt=\"Neurosurgeon Dr. Eric Sauvageau with patient\"></div><p>Less than a year after leaving Baptist, Wilma and her husband were back on the road again, reuniting with other Florida snowbirds and resuming their decades-long quest to travel to every Cracker Barrel restaurant in the country.</p><p>The Yoders, who were married in a traditional Amish wedding, complete with horse and buggy, first started dining at the southern, country-themed restaurants back in the 1970s when Ray was delivering fresh-off-the-factory-floor recreational vehicles for Indiana-based Coachman Industries. He averaged more than 100 deliveries a year, driving to both the East and West coasts. After their four children were grown, Wilma went along for the ride, too.</p><p>&ldquo;We did that for about 30 years. It was an adventure. Basically, we got paid to see the country,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;So, I said, &lsquo;Why not eat good food while we&rsquo;re at it.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p><p>Before Wilma&rsquo;s aneurysm, the couple had visited more than 600 Cracker Barrel locations, including 50 in Florida. In August 2017, the Yoders visited their 645th Cracker Barrel store. Their taste for roadside cuisine (they once stopped at eight Cracker Barrels in a single day) has transformed them into media darlings, drawing the attention of daytime talk show host Steve Harvey, who invited the octogenarians to appear on his nationally syndicated TV program. &ldquo;How can you eat at eight in one day?&rdquo; Harvey asked Ray, who quickly shot back, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat too much at the first one.&rdquo;</p><p>In August 2018, the couple helped cut the ribbon at three new Cracker Barrel stores in California and Oregon, raising the number of stores visited to 652.</p><p>When Dr. Sauvageau recently learned about their eatery exploits, he surprised them with a phone call.</p><p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were on a quest to go to all the Cracker Barrels.&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;Oh, sure. Everybody has some kind of crazy habit,&rsquo; &rdquo; said Ray. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thankful to Dr. Sauvageau for all that he did for us. You just don&rsquo;t make it far on the kind of aneurysm that she had. I don&rsquo;t talk about it too much. When I get ready to say grace at the table, sometimes I don&rsquo;t get through it.&rdquo;</p><p>If you have a family history of aneurysm and would like to learn more about your risks, visit <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health&#39;s Stoke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center</a>.</p>",

After six days of William&rsquo;s high fever, red eyes and sore neck, his doctors decided to send him to <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.org/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a> in Jacksonville.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.org/PROGRAMS-SERVICES/HOSPITAL-SERVICES/Pages/kids-kare.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Kids Kare Mobile intensive care unit</a> transferred William and his mother from Daytona to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, where a team of pediatric critical care experts in the PICU went straight to work.</p><p>&ldquo;All the teams were waiting for him,&rdquo; his mother recalled. &ldquo;They did bloodwork, performed an <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.org/centers-of-distinction/heart/Pages/test.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">echocardiogram</a> to check his heart and he saw an intensivist, all within 45 minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>And then they made their diagnosis: William was suffering from Kawasaki disease, an extremely rare illness that can affect the skin, mouth and lymph nodes. The cause of Kawasaki is unknown and it is hard to diagnose; left untreated, it can lead to potentially fatal heart complications.</p><p>&ldquo;This was an unusual situation, because not only is the disease uncommon, but William&rsquo;s case also presented in a rare way,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/pediatric-infectious-disease-specialist/dr-mobeen-rathore-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mobeen Rathore, MD</a>, chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease and Immunology at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. &ldquo;William was treated with IV doses of gamma globulin to prevent coronary artery disease, and a high dose of aspirin to help relieve his symptoms and lower his fever. He responded well to the treatment and was sent home.&rdquo;</p><p>William did return to Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital a second time for another round of treatment when symptoms returned, which is a common occurrence in Kawasaki disease.</p><p>Dr. Rathore, who also sees kids at the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care Center in Daytona Beach, has expertise in chronic infections and HIV/AIDS research. That training, he said, allows him and his colleagues to &ldquo;recognize the symptoms of very rare and potentially fatal conditions like Kawasaki disease. We&rsquo;re able to act quickly and accurately to diagnose our patients.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am grateful we ended up at Wolfson,&rdquo; Hale said. &ldquo;From the doctors to the pediatric nurses, even the cleaning crew&mdash;everyone at Wolfson was absolutely wonderful.&rdquo;</p><p>And William? He&rsquo;s back to his usual self, attending first grade with all of his friends.</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t guess that he was ever sick,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He is back to jumping on the bed, running around the house and getting into the sort of trouble you would expect from a 6 year old.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Rathore has actually called me personally to check on William several times since his hospitalization. That is just amazing. I grew up in the medical field&mdash;my dad is a doctor&mdash;and that kind of follow-up treatment is rare.&rdquo;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Have you heard people talk about the gut as a second brain? There are important connections between your brain and your digestive system that can explain, among other things, why you get &ldquo;that gut feeling&rdquo; in stressful situations. Here are three reasons why your brain and your gut affect your overall health:</p><ol><li>Serotonin works in your brain, but it&rsquo;s made in your gut &ndash; Serotonin is a messenger, a neurotransmitter that helps your nerves talk to each other. It works to reduce anxiety and depression, heal wounds and regulate sleep.<br><br>The surprising thing is most serotonin comes from your gut. In fact, 95 percent of the serotonin you need for crucial functions is produced in your gut. Research shows that improving digestive health can have a positive impact on anxiety and depression.<br><br></li><li>There&rsquo;s a direct line between your brain and your gut &ndash; It&rsquo;s called the vagus nerve. It starts in the part of your brainstem called the medulla, a major point of information from your brain and spinal cord to the rest of your body. The vagus nerve extends through the abdomen. This physical connection allows the central (brain) and enteric (gut) nervous systems to talk to each other.<br><br>The enteric nervous system is located inside your gut. It&rsquo;s embedded in the lining of your digestive system, from your esophagus all the way to your anus. It can do some things on its own, independent from the brain. It coordinates reflexes, secretes enzymes, and yes, it makes serotonin.<br><br>The connection, through your vagus nerve, between your enteric nervous system and your brain makes it possible for you to feel &ldquo;butterflies in your stomach,&rdquo; feel nervous to the point of having to go to the bathroom, and develop symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).<br><br>Scientists are studying how your gut affects not only your mood, but neurological disorders such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, multiple sclerosis and autism. This is relatively new research through the Human Microbiome Project and ongoing research around the world.<br><br></li><li>When the gut&rsquo;s on fire, the brain&rsquo;s on fire &ndash; Every day stress can affect the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract, causing additional inflammation. That means that when the gut is on fire, the brain is on fire! Chronic inflammation can reduce serotonin levels, resulting in increased anxiety and depression.</li></ol><p>Poor diet can be a risk factor for depression, as unhealthy foods can negatively impact the microbiota (populations of microorganisms in your gut). A healthy balance of good bacteria in the gut can keep not only your mood in balance, but also your immune system. Whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can improve the healthy bacteria in the gut, which can in turn reduce inflammation. Getting enough sleep is also important in reducing inflammation and maintaining a healthy gut.</p><p>Your digestive tract can hold the keys to your overall health.

There are a lot of factors to consider, such as cost, location, accreditation, teacher qualifications, safety and even forms of discipline.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to do your research about the various preschool curriculums,&rdquo; Dr. Andrews said. &ldquo;Some focus on academics while others focus on academics, social/emotional development, manners/etiquette, etc. There are also philosophies that preschools generally adhere to, such as a play-based or academic model.</p><p>&ldquo;Other options include the Waldorf-inspired, Montessori and Reggio Emilia-inspired models. Considering your child&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses, as well as their personality, will determine which model/philosophy you and your child are attracted to.&rdquo;</p><p>Whichever preschool program you choose, know that you are setting the stage for your child to benefit from a lifetime of learning. Your role as parent and teacher will continue to influence your child throughout his or her academic career.</p><p>&ldquo;Social interaction is one of the best activities you can demonstrate and engage in with your child,&rdquo; said Dr. Andrews. &ldquo;He or she will mirror you and your actions, which can provide a solid foundation for learning.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Tips for Early Learning</strong></p><ul><li>Talk, read and sing together every day!</li><li>When you read with your child, have him or her turn the pages. Take turns labeling pictures with your child.</li><li>Use &quot;teachable moments&quot; while driving or at the grocery store to discuss what you see &nbsp; such as colors, shapes and numbers.</li><li>If you are ever worried about your child&rsquo;s development, don&rsquo;t wait! Acting early can make a big difference. Remember, you know your child best. Talk with your child&rsquo;s doctor if you have concerns.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Charles Arthur May came into the world on Monday, April 10, 2017. But minutes later, the 6-pound, 10-ounce infant was struggling for his life.</p><p>&ldquo;As soon as he was pulled from the womb, I noticed he wasn&rsquo;t crying. He was gasping for air,&rdquo; said the boy&#39;s father, Jimmy May, who has been present for the birth of all four of his children. &ldquo;They told me they needed to take him to their neonatal intensive care unit. I asked, &lsquo;Can my wife give him a kiss first?&rsquo; &rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Almost immediately after that parting kiss, baby Charles had to be sedated so he could tolerate being placed on a ventilator. Less than 48 hours later, he was transferred to the <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.org/programs-services/hospital-services/neonatology/Pages/NICU.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">high-level NICU</a> at <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.org/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>. Doctors there determined that the infant had persistent pulmonary hypertension, a serious disorder in which the arteries to the lungs remain constricted after delivery, thus limiting the amount of blood flow to the lungs and oxygen to the bloodstream.</p><p>To remedy the situation, Charles was placed <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.org/programs-services/hospital-services/Pages/ecmo.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO</a>, to allow more time for his lungs and heart to rest and heal. The technology circulated the newborn&rsquo;s blood through a machine that adds oxygen while removing carbon dioxide, then returns the blood to the newborn. The technology, now in its 10th year at Wolfson Children&#39;s, &ldquo;gives hope to parents and children,&rdquo; said Karen Grissinger, MSN, manager of the hospital&rsquo;s ECMO program, which has been recognized as a Gold Level Center for Excellence in Life Support.</p><p>&ldquo;Once he was hooked up to the machine, he showed great progress,&rdquo; recalled Jimmy May, whose son was listed as critical when he arrived at Wolfson. &ldquo;Between being on the ventilator and the ECMO machine, he was completely knocked out for six days. It was a harrowing experience.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Charles Arthur May, who is named after his mother&rsquo;s father and grandfather, spent 20 days in the hospital before being discharged with a clean bill of health. &ldquo;Sometimes, I just call him &lsquo;Miracle,&rsquo; &rdquo; the boy&#39;s father said.</p>",

A Rosie the Riveter outfit represented strength, and superhero costumes celebrated the last treatment, signifying for Rojas that &ldquo;chemo was tough, but I was tougher.&rdquo;</p><p>She said dressing up has been a fun way to get her family and friends involved while helping keep her mind off treatment. Like most, Rojas went through the stages of being upset, sad, worried and scared, but on her fifth of 12 chemotherapy sessions, she decided to take control and turn things around.</p><p>&ldquo;If I had to sit there for a few hours to get this medicine, I decided I might as well make the most of it, and it&rsquo;s been nice bringing smiles to nurses and patients,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Before her diagnosis, Rojas spent months going to various doctors with symptoms of itching, feeling tired and fatigued, and having spots on her arms. Various antibiotics and lotions did nothing to clear up those symptoms.</p><p>A lymph node in her neck was swollen for months. She was referred to <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/otolaryngologist-ent/dr-scott-scharer-md\">Scott Scharer, MD,</a> an otolaryngologist at Baptist ENT Specialists.

Remission rates can be as high as 70 to 80 percent in some patients. It is one of the more curable cancers.&rdquo;</p><p>Rojas&rsquo;s prognosis is good, Dr. Gorak said. Midway through her chemotherapy treatments, a PET scan showed marked improvement, with the cancer having shrunk significantly. Rojas will have another scan in late summer.</p><p>Her spirit and costume themed-treatments also helped.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s great and unique. It has helped her cope and she has a great support system. It&rsquo;s helping her get through her therapy,&rdquo; Dr. Gorak said.</p><p>Rojas added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m generally a happy-go-lucky person. But I had to tough it out. I&rsquo;ve tried to remain positive and just jump through the hoops and do what I need to do and move on from there.&rdquo;</p><p>Stepping back and accepting help from others has not been easy, she said, but she&rsquo;s grateful for her large support system of friends and family, including her mom, stepfather, dad, brother and two sisters.</p><p>&ldquo;She just has so much strength,&rdquo; said her mom, Edye Wagner. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always been strong-willed and the person who is always there for everybody else.

She keeps going,&rdquo; John Rojas said. &ldquo;Dressing up helps take her mind off of it and gives her an incentive not to feel bad.&rdquo;</p><p>The infusion nurses at Baptist MD Anderson and at her oncologist&rsquo;s office also enjoyed seeing which theme was next. The infusion team even decorated her area on her last day of treatment and greeted her with superhero signs and masks.</p><p>&ldquo;I always enjoyed seeing what the theme was going to be. She goes above and beyond,&rdquo; said Nicole Bautista, medical assistant. &ldquo;She always has a smile. If she doesn&rsquo;t, I know something is wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>One of her infusion nurses, Frankie Smith, RN, happened to have a tutu in her car left over from Halloween when Rojas and her friends dressed in the &ldquo;tutus and touchdowns&rdquo; theme.

All agreed she was suffering from a brain aneurysm, a balloon-like bulge in a blood vessel. But they had very different ideas about how to treat it.</p><p>No one seemed to be able to put Mellem&rsquo;s anxious mind at ease. &ldquo;There were a lot of different opinions,&rdquo; said the 32-year-old mother of three from Curitiba, a populous city about 400 miles south of Rio de Janeiro. &ldquo;I was very confused.&rdquo;</p><p>But a chance meeting at her daughter&rsquo;s school convinced Mellem to put her complex case in the hands of a fellow Brazilian more than 4,000 miles away in the U.S.</p><p>A day before she was scheduled to undergo an angiogram, an X-ray to examine the blood flow in her brain, Mellem was dropping off her 5-year-old daughter at school in Curitiba when she ran into a fellow parent who happened to be a physician.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Larissa mentioned to the physician that she was having an angiogram the next day, and the physician immediately got goose bumps. She said her father had a similar experience a year earlier,&rdquo; explained Mellem&rsquo;s husband, Rafael. &ldquo;The physician suggested that before we have the angiogram, we talk to the same doctor who performed her father&rsquo;s surgery.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size1of2 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1522268311/Juice/Brazil_patient.jpg\" alt=\"Larissa Mellem, a patient, works with Neurosurgeon Dr. Ricardo Hanel\"></div><p>That doctor turned out to be <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-ricardo-hanel-md\" target=\"_blank\">Ricardo Hanel, MD, PhD</a>, a Brazilian-born endovascular neurosurgeon and co-director of the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/lyerly-neurosurgery/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-care?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvJDO49OO1wIVAWSGCh3GYAG5EAAYASAAEgKaTvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>. Dr. Hanel, a recognized expert in alternative methods to dealing with small and medium-sized brain aneurysms like Mellem&rsquo;s, advised the couple to come to Jacksonville for the angiogram.</p><p>Dr. Hanel said he believed Mellem&rsquo;s aneurysm could be successfully treated with an FDA-approved device known as Pipeline that is inserted through a microcatheter into an artery in the groin.

That&rsquo;s because the Jacksonville native, who played for the NHL&rsquo;s Boston Bruins and an affiliate of the Edmonton Oilers, suffered a severe knee injury in middle school.</p><p>In 2005, Ferlin not only tore the anterior cruciate ligament in one of his knees, he had what&rsquo;s known as an avulsion fracture, where a bone fragment pulls away from the ligament. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very unusual for an athlete to tear the ACL in such a way where we are able to repair it,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/orthopedic-surgeon/dr-stephen-lucie-md\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Lucie, MD</a>, an orthopedic surgeon with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/jacksonville-orthopaedic-institute\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</a>. &ldquo;But I was able to repair and suture through the bone, which was less invasive than reconstruction.&rdquo;</p><p>The ACL injury sidelined Ferlin, a former multi-sport athlete at The Bolles School, for about six months. After rehab, he decided to concentrate solely on hockey. He got so good at it that he was recruited to play in the top amateur league in the country before being drafted by the Bruins in 2011.</p><p>After a stint in the minors, Ferlin, who also played hockey at Cornell University, stepped on NHL ice for the first time in February 2015, realizing a childhood dream that began when he first strapped on skates at age 4. He retired from pro hockey in 2018, after suiting up for the American Hockey League&#39;s Bakersfield Condor.</p><p>&ldquo;The most enjoyable part about the practice of sports medicine is seeing people like Brian fulfill their dreams,&quot; said Dr. Lucie, formerly the head team physician for the NFL&rsquo;s Jacksonville Jaguars.</p><p>Added Ferlin: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really thankful to Dr. Lucie.

The 6-year-old also needed several stitches to repair the tip of her finger.</p><p>Aside from her concern about Ava&rsquo;s injury, Chilko was unfamiliar with the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-clay-medical-campus\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Emergency Center at Baptist Clay Medical Campus</a>, where the camp counselors brought her. Because the Chilkos are a military family, the only experience they&rsquo;d ever had in the two years since husband Scott was stationed at NAS Jacksonville was with the base&rsquo;s naval hospital.</p><p>But as the team in the Emergency Center jumped into action, Chilko said her fears began to fade as she noticed the effort being made to make the experience as kid-friendly as possible for Ava. It put both mom and daughter at ease.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything was so easy and done right; it was just so seamless,&rdquo; said Chilko. &ldquo;I work in pediatric dentistry with kids, so I know how it is. I was blown away by how amazing the experience was for us.&rdquo;</p><p>Ava spent two weeks in a splint and recently had her stitches out. Her finger is still on the mend and she kept her fingernail, which she nearly lost in the accident.</p><p>In September 2016, 5-year-old Hudson McWilliams fell off the monkey bars and landed on his left arm. In a panic, his dad took him to the closest ER where they waited hours to be seen. Once back, his mom Kristen said Hudson was given medication that put him to sleep for hours while X-rays were taken and his arm was set.</p><p>Hudson went home but all the next day, he was in a lot of pain. McWilliams called an out-of-state pediatrician friend who compared the before-and-after X-rays and noted that there wasn&rsquo;t a difference between the broken bone and the &ldquo;set&rdquo; break.</p><p>Her friend recommended she take Hudson straight to the local children&rsquo;s hospital for further evaluation. The next morning, the family headed to <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/programs-services/hospital-services/Pages/emergency.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Emergency Center</a> in Jacksonville.</p><p>&ldquo;When we arrived at the pediatric emergency room and saw how it different it was, and that it was specialized to treat children, we realized we were in a whole different world,&rdquo; recalled McWilliams. &ldquo;A pediatric orthopedic surgeon with Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care had to re-set his arm in the Wolfson ER but this time, a Child Life specialist came in with an iPad to distract him while they started his IV so he barely noticed it. And the sedation was light enough for him to be out of it during the procedure, not out for hours.&rdquo;</p><p>Knowing that a highly skilled pediatric radiologist read his X-ray and that a Nemours pediatric orthopedic surgeon set Hudson&rsquo;s arm also gave them great peace of mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Pediatric radiologists receive training in problems that are particular to infants and children, and they are trained to accurately read CT scans, MRI and X-rays according to the needs of children,&rdquo; said Robert DeFlorio, MD, a Nemours <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/programs-services/hospital-services/imaging/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">pediatric radiologist</a>&nbsp;at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>Dr. DeFlorio added that kids heal quickly so it&rsquo;s important to diagnose and fix a fracture correctly to avoid future complications.</p><p>Hudson spent eight weeks in a cast and another eight in a soft cast while his arm healed. Today, he is back playing soccer, baseball and, of course, climbing on whatever he can.</p><p>&ldquo;After this experience, we&rsquo;ll never go anywhere else,&rdquo; McWilliams said.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Michael Mayotte&rsquo;s easygoing personality doesn&rsquo;t seem like the drill sergeant many of us might imagine in a wellness coach. In fact, his No. 1 piece of health advice is to have fun.</p><p>Fun? Doesn&rsquo;t getting healthier mean trading in desserts for diets? The couch for crunches? Twinkies for tofu?&nbsp;</p><p>Not according to Mayotte, a wellness coach at the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/y-healthy-living-centers\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Y Healthy Living Center</a> in Mandarin. &ldquo;Small tweaks can make a big difference. Just 150 minutes of activity a week can lower your blood pressure and get your heart in better shape.&rdquo; The key, he says, is finding an activity that you enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going to do something you hate, so if running isn&rsquo;t your thing, pick something else,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Even walking your dog more often can help. I help people find activities they like and fit into their everyday life.&rdquo;</p><p>Mayotte likes running, but his favorite activities are soccer and Frisbee golf because they make him feel like a kid again. &ldquo;Remember when you were little? Exercising was fun and most of the time, you didn&rsquo;t even realize you were doing it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>People of all ages, sizes and fitness levels are among Mayotte&rsquo;s clients. You don&rsquo;t have to be a YMCA member and the wellness coaching is free.&nbsp;</p><p>All the wellness coaches at Baptist Y Healthy Living centers share one common trait that this is a &ldquo;no judgment zone.&rdquo; He recalled one client coming in after missing a few sessions saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be mad at me.&rdquo; Instead, Mayotte helped her focus on going forward.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone is going to have ups and downs, and that&#39;s OK. We all have birthday parties, vacations and holidays. It&rsquo;s all about making small changes along the way toward your goal and getting back on track,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the first steps is usually a health screening, which includes blood pressure, body composition, cholesterol, triglycerides and blood sugar. Each session lasts about an hour. &ldquo;Getting a health screening isn&rsquo;t mandatory, Mayotte said, but it&rsquo;s a good idea because it gives you a baseline to compare and see your progress.</p><p>&ldquo;Every client is different and their goals are different. For some, it&rsquo;s maintaining their health and for others, it&rsquo;s stepping it up to the next level. Whatever a person&rsquo;s goals are, our job is to be by their side to help them get there,&rdquo; Mayotte said. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for him to email or call with an encouraging word.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s what he likes about his job &ndash; getting to know people and helping them get healthier. &ldquo;My favorite part is the look on someone&rsquo;s face when it all clicks and they begin to understand how much control they have over their own health.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s neat to see people turn their health around,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>Baptist has five Y Healthy Living centers &ndash; at the Ys in Mandarin, Ponte Vedra, Riverside, Northside and the new ER on Dunn Avenue. The medical director is <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-aristides-sastre-md\" target=\"_blank\">Aristides Sastre, MD</a>, a family physician for <a href=\"http://baptistjax.com\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>You can make an appointment with a wellness coach by calling 904.202.CARE (2273).

She excused herself, went into another room, sat on the floor and cried. She had cancer. An MRI would later show she had two tumors and the cancer had spread to some of her lymph nodes.</p><p>&ldquo;I have two boys so there really was no other option for me except to pull myself up and move on and beat this,&rdquo; she recalled. &ldquo;To stop for me would have been choosing not to live and that was not a choice.&rdquo;</p><p>Eger had an aggressive form of breast cancer, called HER2-positive, short for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Cancer cells have too much of the growth-promoting protein on their surface, and breast cancers with too much HER2 grow and spread more aggressively without special treatment.</p><p>Eger was given a new treatment that combines traditional chemotherapy with two antibodies. Administered intravenously, the drugs work together to shrink tumors, slow the progress of the cancer and increase survival rates.</p><p>&ldquo;Attacking cancer cells from several different directions is the future so we can minimize the likelihood of resistance to treatment,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/hematologist-oncologist/dr-robert-zaiden-md\">Robert Zaiden, MD,</a> Eger&rsquo;s medical oncologist at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;With more precision and selectivity, it goes straight in and binds to the (HER2) receptor and makes it harder for cancer cells to divide and grow,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>The treatment is called neoadjuvant TCHP chemotherapy and gets its name from the four drugs (Taxotere, Carboplatin, Herceptin and Perjeta. The antibodies are Herceptin (also known as trastuzumab) and Perjeta (pertuzumab).</p><p>The combined therapy is administered before surgery to shrink the tumor and minimize the risk of the cancer metastasizing. Following the treatment, Eger had a double mastectomy at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>. She then continued with radiation and was on Herceptin treatment at Baptist MD Anderson, which she finished this past Spring.</p><p><strong>Nurses and caterpillars</strong></p><p>Eger&rsquo;s inspiration came from her boys, ages 6 and 9, and her husband, Marcus.</p><p>She gave her 9-year-old a journal for him to write questions or comments about her diagnosis.</p><p>Sometimes he would write, &ldquo;I hope you are feeling better&rdquo; and sometimes he would ask, &ldquo;When is the chemo going to be over?&rdquo; He would leave it on her bed or hand it to her at night. Her 6-year-old gave her his stuffed animals to take care of her. A caterpillar stayed with her when she recovered from surgery.</p><p>She also credited the nurses who often held her hand and helped her through her treatment. &ldquo;Without them, I would have struggled. They were there for me all the way through and were just so supportive and sweet,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>She is now on maintenance medication and encourages others not to give up.</p><p>&ldquo;There certainly were days I didn&rsquo;t think I would get through it and there were days I asked Dr. Zaiden, &lsquo;Why am I doing this again? Please help me remember,&rsquo;&rdquo; she recalled. &ldquo;But you can get through. It&rsquo;s not going to be fun or the best thing you&rsquo;ve done in your life, but you can get through it.&rdquo;</p>",

Her aneurysm remains gone.</p><p>The hugs continued</p><p>&ldquo;My friend asked me the other day, &lsquo;What do you say to the man who saved your life?&rdquo; Bean told Dr. Hanel, as tears filled her eyes. &ldquo;There are no words.&rdquo;</p>",

She also wondered how she was going to enjoy her wedding anniversary cruise in the New Year and host more than a dozen family members at her home during the holidays.</p><p>After seeing multiple physicians and physical therapy and steroid injections provided no relief, she had just about given up hope.</p><p>But Brooks&rsquo; life turned around in December 2016, when she had minimally invasive, outpatient hip surgery at <a href=\"http://www.joionline.net/\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</a>. Just weeks later, she cooked and entertained guests for Christmas. In January, she cruised to Mexico.</p><p>&ldquo;The surgery was awesome. It couldn&rsquo;t have gone more smoothly if I had planned it that way,&rdquo; said Brooks. She credited her orthopedic surgeon, <a href=\"http://www.joionline.net/physicians/bio/carl_freeman_md/\">Carl R. Freeman</a>, MD, and his team for her smooth recovery and getting her procedure done quickly so she could finish physical therapy and feel good enough for her trip. &ldquo;That meant a lot to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Freeman found her pain was caused by a mechanical disorder of the hip joint called hip impingement, a condition in which an abnormal shape of the ball and socket causes pain and joint damage of the hip.</p><p>Using the newest techniques of hip arthroscopy and minimally invasive surgery, Dr. Freeman was able to correct the disorder and her hip was reshaped to stop the pain. Hip arthroscopy uses a scope to view the hip joint without making a large cut through the skin and soft tissue. The hip preservation surgery avoids a hip replacement.</p><p>Brooks, 61, was amazed at how great she felt almost immediately. &ldquo;The procedure made my pain go away,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Freeman&rsquo;s bedside manner was great,&rdquo; said Brooks, who worked in the medical field most of her adult life, including as an office manager, before recently retiring.</p><p>&ldquo;He was very detailed and explained everything before and after the surgery to me and my husband. He took more time than most and more than what some would have found necessary.&rdquo;</p><p>After physical therapy, Brooks said she was able to sit pain free and enjoy her children and grandchildren during the holidays. She even pushed her 13-month-old granddaughter in a stroller.</p><p>&ldquo;At no time did I feel like I was too dependent and not able to do what I wanted to do and have fun with my family,&rdquo; Brooks said.</p><p>While she&rsquo;s not back on a motorcycle, she&rsquo;s on her treadmill several times a week and stationary bike almost daily.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Lying on the operating room table with blood transfusing into her body, Tanedra DuBose looked at her fianc&eacute;, said &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; and took what she thought would be her last breath.</p><p>The next thing the 31-year-old mother heard were the cries of her newborn daughter as doctors feverishly worked to bring her first child into the world during an urgent C-section.</p><p>&ldquo;She gasped for air and it felt like we both took in the same air,&rdquo; DuBose recalled three days later in her hospital room at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville,&nbsp;</a>with tears streaming down her face. &ldquo;It was the most beautiful sound. They brought her up to me and I gave her a kiss. After that, I couldn&rsquo;t actually believe I was alive. It was so surreal.&rdquo;</p><p>Her fianc&eacute;, Johnathan, whom she first met in 7th grade on the track team at Twin Lakes Academy Middle school in Jacksonville, tried distracting her during the delivery by singing and playing her favorite country and R &amp; B dance songs on his cell phone.</p><p>Doctors at Baptist Jacksonville had been monitoring DuBose since December 2016 because of a heart valve problem. With her health deteriorating, they performed the C-section on Jan. 20, 2017, even though she was only 30 weeks pregnant.</p><p>DuBose said she spent the day and night before praying and coming to terms with God that she might not live to meet or hold her daughter. She told her fianc&eacute; to let their daughter know she loved her very much.</p><p>She knew the odds. She had recently lost four great aunts to heart issues and signed legal papers two days before to ensure her daughter was cared for if she didn&rsquo;t make it.</p><p>&ldquo;My aunts were always on my mind,&rdquo; DuBose said. &ldquo;I thought about my baby, my family and my fianc&eacute;. In the end, if I was not able to meet her or hold her or kiss her, I knew her dad would be strong enough to raise her. I knew she would be born into a family that cared about her.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Coordinated care</strong></p><p>DuBose was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in May 2015, after feeling shortness of breath and passing out at her home in Arlington, where she lives with her fianc&eacute;.</p><p>Doctors found DuBose has a leaky heart valve, known as mitral regurgitation, where blood flows backward and forces the heart to work harder to pump blood through her body while causing blood to back up into her lungs. Ultimately, this problem led to high blood pressure in her lungs known as pulmonary hypertension. &nbsp;She was monitored and placed on medication for her heart and blood pressure, she said.</p><p>Deciding to start a family, she became pregnant in June 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>But on Nov. 12&mdash;her birthday&mdash;DuBose was coughing again. She thought it might be an upper respiratory problem from the change in the weather. But as days and weeks went by, her cough became worse and she couldn&rsquo;t keep food down or talk.</p><p>She also had excessive swelling in her legs and feet, but she thought it might be because she was pregnant. On Dec. 31, when she and her fianc&eacute; had planned to be in Georgia getting married, she couldn&rsquo;t breathe and could barely walk.</p><p>At the Baptist Jacksonville emergency room, more than four liters of fluid were removed from her body. Doctors said they&rsquo;d have to monitor her at the hospital until the baby&rsquo;s birth, expected in March.</p><p>At times, depression set in.</p><p>&ldquo;I would wake up not knowing what the next day would hold and would wonder if the only way I would feel my daughter is through my stomach,&rdquo; DuBose said. &ldquo;It was a scary time.&rdquo;</p><p>Her hospital stay took a dramatic turn on Jan. 18 when the fluid once again built up in her body and lungs and she became short of breath. Doctors told her they would have to take the baby in the next 24 to 48 hours.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a very tenuous situation and she started to deteriorate,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/maternal-and-fetal-medicine-specialist/dr-kathryn-villano-md\" target=\"_blank\">Kathryn S. Villano, MD</a>, medical director for Regional Obstetric Consultants, who specializes in maternal-fetal medicine and was involved throughout her pregnancy. &ldquo;She had a mortality risk of 30 to 40 percent during delivery or shortly after. She is definitely a success story.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/obstetrician-and-gynecologist/dr-rahil-malik-md\" target=\"_blank\">Rahil Malik, MD</a>, an obstetrician and gynecologist with North Florida OB/GYN who performed the C-section, said DuBose had several medical issues such as heart failure, anemia and large uterine fibroids that could have complicated the delivery process.</p><p>&ldquo;We had to operate rapidly to make sure blood loss was minimal,&rdquo; Dr. Malik said.</p><p>Coordinated care was the key. Multiple specialists of more than a dozen physicians and nurses were involved throughout her pregnancy, including maternal-fetal medicine, intensive care, cardiology, neonatology, anesthesia and pulmonology.</p><p>&ldquo;One of the benefits of delivering at Baptist Jacksonville is that our physicians are routinely exposed to medically complex patients and can coordinate care with multiple specialists,&rdquo; Dr. Malik said. &ldquo;Had (DuBose) been at a small, suburban hospital without these specialists and services available, she may not have had such a positive outcome.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>A beautiful rose</strong></p><p>DuBose said it&rsquo;s been a tough journey, but she was never alone.</p><p>Her fianc&eacute;, family and extended family were by her side. The team at Baptist Jacksonville in Labor and Delivery, on the Postpartum and Newborn floors and in the Intensive Care Unit gave her encouragement and hugs throughout her stay, from nursing to housekeeping.</p><p>&ldquo;It brought tears to my eyes. It&rsquo;s refreshing to know your life means something to someone other than your family,&rdquo; DuBose said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the words to express how this hospital, this team, this group of people have treated me and my family.&rdquo;</p><p>Cicely Brooks, perinatal services director for Baptist Health and vice president of Patient Care Operations for <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.org\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&#39;s Hospit</a>al, said she was very proud of the level of care the teams were able to provide DuBose, including teams in the ICU and operating room as well as neonatal care providers, OB staff and specialists.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone was on the same page when it came to having a safe delivery,&rdquo; Brooks said. &ldquo;Our team was able to pull everything together and go above and beyond to make sure she was comfortable. We treated her like family because she could be a family member.&rdquo;</p><p>Today, as she recovers, DuBose steals moments with her new baby girl and she&rsquo;s grateful they both are alive.</p><p>In the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital Newborn Intensive Care Unit, she reached through a small hole in the specialized enclosed bed and touched her three-pound daughter&rsquo;s delicate hand. She then whispered, &ldquo;Savannah. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s your momma. Hey, gorgeous.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Her daughter is doing well, Brooks said, and continues to develop with the help of a tiny feeding tube.</p><p>&ldquo;I always prayed and asked God what is my purpose in life. I never knew until now,&rdquo; DuBose said. &ldquo;I found out my purpose is to share my story to give someone else hope and to let them know it will be OK if you just trust in prayer.&rdquo;</p><p>She is also encouraging others to listen to their body.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you think it is something minor, don&rsquo;t ignore the signs. If something doesn&rsquo;t sit well with you, go get it checked,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>As she looks to the future, which will involve a repair of her heart valve, and taking her daughter home, DuBose and her mom have nicknamed her Baby Rose because of her rosy color.</p><p>&ldquo;She came from this dark place (a body battling health issues) and she blossomed into this beautiful rose,&rdquo; she said.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Several weeks before Jennifer Schmidt was due, her baby girl went into the breech position. Plans for a natural water birth gave way to a safer C-section.</p><p>The turn of events disappointed the first-time mother-to-be, but Schmidt soon saw that it had been a blessing in disguise. When Olivia was born in August 2016, she was severely anemic and had extremely low blood sugar.</p><p>&ldquo;Within four hours of her birth, Olivia&rsquo;s condition began to disintegrate,&rdquo; Schmidt recalled. &ldquo;Had we done the natural birth and been sent home within a few hours, a lot of things could have gone wrong. That was the beginning of what we feel has been a series of miracles for our little girl.&rdquo;</p><p>Rushed to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Olivia was given several blood transfusions. While the transfusions fixed her anemia, her blood sugar never quite normalized.</p><p><a href=\"http://ufhealthjax.org/doctors/2610/josef-cortez/\" target=\"_blank\">Josef Cortez, MD</a>, a neonatologist with the <a href=\"http://hscj.ufl.edu/medicine/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Florida College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville</a>, had a hunch that something wasn&rsquo;t right, even though Olivia&rsquo;s levels were only a little off. He transferred her to <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/Pages/default.aspx\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>, where <a href=\"http://bhwebapps.bmcjax.com/wolfsonfap/profile.aspx?id=712\">Nelly Mauras, MD</a>, director of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Institute at <a href=\"https://www.nemours.org/locations/specialty-care/florida-pediatric-specialty-care-jacksonville.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville</a>, and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, discovered the problem.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Tests showed that her pituitary gland wasn&rsquo;t functioning appropriately because there was a tumor on it,&rdquo; Schmidt recalled. &ldquo;Three days after that, our little girl was having brain surgery.&rdquo;</p><p>Olivia had a <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/health-library/disease/craniopharyngioma\">craniopharyngioma</a>, a brain tumor that forms near or on the pituitary gland, impacting many bodily functions including metabolism, blood pressure, growth and reproduction.</p><p>Not only are the tumors rare, they&rsquo;re not usually found in newborns. But because it was identified early, it could be treated before it caused any more damage to Olivia&rsquo;s developing body.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Chemotherapy and radiation were risky to her developing brain because she was so young, so we made the decision to remove it,&rdquo; said Philipp Aldana, MD, pediatric neurosurgeon at UF College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville, and co-medical director of the <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/centers-of-distinction/neuroscience/Pages/default.aspx\">Stys Neuroscience Institute</a> at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. &ldquo;With craniopharyngiomas, surgery is only effective if we can remove the entire tumor because of the high likelihood that it will come back.&rdquo;</p><p>During the delicate six-hour surgery, Dr. Aldana and his pediatric neurosurgery team went in through Olivia&rsquo;s forehead and carefully made their way underneath the lobes of her brain, navigating around critical structures like the optic nerves and carotid arteries. Once at the site, they removed the entire blueberry-sized tumor, along with her pituitary gland.</p><p>As a consequence, Olivia will be on life-long hormone replacement. But having the surgery at such a young age spares her from the many developmental delays she would have endured otherwise.</p><p>In addition, the growing tumor would eventually have caused problems like vision loss and headaches as it pressed on surrounding tissues.</p><p>&ldquo;There is always a small chance of recurrence so we will continue to monitor Olivia with regular MRIs, but her prognosis is good,&rdquo; Dr. Aldana said. She will be followed by the pediatric oncology team at the <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/centers-of-distinction/neuroscience/Pages/neuro_oncology_center.aspx\">Neuro-Oncology Center</a> at the Stys Neuroscience Institute at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s.</p><p>As she approaches her first birthday, Olivia continues to keep up with developmental milestones. And she&rsquo;s keeping big smiles on her parents&rsquo; faces. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s hand has been on her since the beginning, but we also had the most talented and caring medical team who were truly dedicated to her success,&rdquo; Schmidt said. &ldquo;Just like we prayed for, our little girl is one in a million.&rdquo;</p>",

In the confusion of the moment, she noticed something else: No one knew how to properly care for the severely injured victim before medical help arrived.</p><p>&ldquo;It was at that moment that I said to myself, &lsquo;I want to be the person who knows what to do,&rsquo;&rdquo; recalled <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-trachella-foy-md\">Tra&rsquo;Chella Johnson Foy, MD</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health</a> family physician who witnessed the wall collapse in the early 1980s while growing up in a West Jacksonville public housing project known as Hollybrook.</p><p>&ldquo;A doctor is someone who is trained to save somebody&rsquo;s life and that&rsquo;s what I wanted to become.&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s easier said than done.</p><p>Despite ranking third in her graduating class at Ribault High School, Dr. Foy lacked the financial resources to apply to colleges when she was 17. Her mother was fresh out of drug rehab, but her father continued to battle drug abuse and mental health issues. If not for the love and support of her uncle and other friends and relatives, Dr. Foy said, she may never have reached her full potential.</p><p>&ldquo;My background is replete with a lot of challenges,&rdquo; added the Jacksonville native, the first African-American woman to be elected president of the Duval County Medical Society. &ldquo;Both of my parents were on drugs. For a time, we lived in an abandoned house without lights and running water. I used to pray to God to not wake me up in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>But Dr. Foy wouldn&rsquo;t let her dire circumstances define her. She was determined to make it to college and her involvement in Ribault&rsquo;s Marine Corps Junior Reserve Officers&rsquo; Training program, then headed by retired 1st Sgt. Molbro Roberts, helped ensure she could fulfill her college ambitions.</p><p>&ldquo;Sarge helped me facilitate that dream by paying my application fees to the University of Florida (UF) and Florida State,&rdquo; said Dr. Foy, who earned a Presidential scholarship to UF, where she spent summers working in the College of Medicine&rsquo;s Office of Minority Relations.</p><p>&ldquo;Going to college was a big deal, knowing that I came from places like Hollybrook and the Sherwood Forest neighborhood,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My goal was always to get a medical degree and go back and serve the community where I grew up.&rdquo;</p><p>She made good on that promise. After attending medical school at Morehouse College in Atlanta, home to the National Center for Primary Care, Dr. Foy served a three-year residency in primary medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, where she earned awards for excellence in graduate medical education and outstanding clinical skills in patient care.</p><p>During her third year of medical school, she was one of only eight medical students in the country to receive an Arthur Ashe AIDS Care fellowship to the Harvard AIDS Institute in Boston. The fellowship is designed to increase the number of minority physicians involved in AIDS-related clinical care. As a medical resident in Jacksonville, she volunteered at a free clinic for substance abusers and underserved mental health patients, eventually becoming its volunteer medical director.</p><p>Today, the community-conscious family physician and mother of one serves as a board member for several professional organizations and a coalition of health care providers offering primary and specialty care to the underserved in Jacksonville. She&rsquo;s also an alternate delegate to the American Medical Association and vice president of the minority-based Northeast Florida Medical Society.</p><p>&ldquo;Until I joined a medical society, I didn&rsquo;t realize that doctors needed advocacy, too,&rdquo; added the Florida Medical Association council member. &ldquo;Doctors need to have a say in changes that may occur in their profession.&rdquo;</p><p>After spending 12 years as a primary care physician on Jacksonville&rsquo;s Northside, Dr. Foy, a diabetes master clinician with expertise in most chronic conditions, joined Baptist Primary Care&rsquo;s Larmoyeux Clinic in downtown Jacksonville. The clinic traces its roots to Julia A. Larmoyeux, MD, a trailblazing physician in Jacksonville in the early 1900s who served as president of the Florida Osteopathic Medical Association from 1919 to 1920.</p><p>&ldquo;The Larmoyeuxes have been staples in the community for decades, and I&rsquo;m honored to be a part of a historic practice and continue the legacy of its founders,&rdquo; said Dr. Foy, who works alongside <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-louis-larmoyeux-do\" target=\"_blank\">Louis J.

Their name is a darkly humorous reminder of the common thread that bonds them &ndash; surviving heart attacks or heart disease.</p><p>King, aka Bruce Houck, for example, got his nickname for having the most cardiac events. He had three heart attacks in 1992, 1996 and 2001; open heart bypass surgery in 2002 and has a pacemaker and defibrillator.</p><p>&ldquo;He has more scars than he has skin,&rdquo; joked Muraski, called Beach Magnet because he once worked as a lifeguard, who had a heart attack in 2003 at age 45. &nbsp;&ldquo;I only have three stents.&rdquo;</p><p>They tease each other while walking on the treadmills at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-beaches\">Baptist Medical Center Beaches</a> Cardiac and Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center, talking freely about politics, health and sports.</p><p>But make no mistake about it, they have each other&rsquo;s back. They take each other to doctor&rsquo;s appointments, if needed, celebrate birthdays, participate in heart walks and other fundraising events, and even go to rock `n&rsquo; roll concerts.</p><p>&ldquo;This is like a support group,&rdquo; said Lonnie Awerdick, 73, known as Looney, who started in cardiac rehab in 2007 after an aortic valve replacement.</p><p>The group, which includes men and women, formed loosely in 2003 with a dozen people, most of them in their 50s who were doing cardiac rehabilitation at Baptist Beaches. Their bond was so strong that they continued in the follow-up program twice a week ever since to encourage each other to exercise. They have T-shirts and bumper stickers with their logo of &ndash; appropriately &ndash; a heart inside a skeleton.</p><p>Their name was born when they were the youngest people in rehab and didn&rsquo;t like the Big Band music played at the Center.</p><p>&ldquo;We love rock `n&rsquo; roll and we&rsquo;re grateful to be alive,&rdquo; said Houck, who with other Grateful Undead members started bringing in CDs and then iPods to play their music.</p><p>Sara Holloway, coordinator of the rehab center, didn&rsquo;t give the group a choice but to stay alive, said Lewis Story, 73, known as Flash because he takes a lot of photos of the group. Story started cardiac rehab in 2001 at Baptist Beaches after having a heart attack. His father and grandfather died from a heart attack and his mother had congestive heart failure.</p><p>The group fondly calls Holloway &ldquo;The Warden&rdquo; because she keeps them in shape.</p><p>Many in the group credit Holloway and <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/cardiologist/dr-pamela-rama-md\">Pamela Rama,</a> MD, cardiologist for Baptist Heart Specialists and medical director of the program, for saving their lives.</p><p>&ldquo;They really connected with each other and many didn&rsquo;t have friends who had a cardiac event since they were so young at the time,&rdquo; said Holloway, who helped start the cardiac rehab program at Beaches in 1993. &ldquo;There is a lot of research that shows that being connected with a group improves your health and increases longevity.&rdquo;</p><p>Beaches is just one of the cardiac rehab programs at Baptist Health&rsquo;s area hospitals. Physicians, dietitians and exercise physiologists throughout the system work together to provide patients information about heart health, physical fitness, nutrition and stress management.</p><p>Baptist Medical Center Nassau recently opened its new Cardiac Rehabilitation Center on the main hospital campus.</p><p>&ldquo;This keeps us engaged so you don&rsquo;t lose the lifestyle of exercising,&rdquo; Houck said. &ldquo;When you have a heart attack, you are scared to death that you are going to die. But then you talk to people like us who have been through it.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Rama said the Grateful Undead inspire each other and other patients at the center to remain healthy and they &ldquo;share a love for life, good food and fun times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am proud that I have had the opportunity to take care of a lot of the men and women in this group. Theirs is a special bond,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Katie Blaylock, 22, who also exercises at the center but is not a member of the group, likes talking to the Grateful Undead and listening to their music despite their age differences. She also enjoys the staff at Baptist Beaches.</p><p>&ldquo;They treat you like family here,&rdquo; Blaylock said.</p><p>The group has added new members over the years, and more are always welcome.</p><p>Muraski said he never liked the atmosphere of a traditional gym. &ldquo;Here, we are all the same and we&rsquo;ve become best friends,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>Bert Livingston, who has a family history of heart disease, was 48 in 2001 when doctors found he had 99 percent blockage of the &ldquo;widowmaker,&quot; which describes the complete closure of the left anterior descending coronary artery and can result in immediate death.</p><p>&ldquo;This group keeps me alive and mowing the lawn,&rdquo; said Livingston, who enjoys walking on the treadmill, hence his nickname, TMO, or Treadmill Only. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m able to stay on a schedule with a bunch of people who I like.&rdquo;</p><p>Terry Andrews, 70, who is called Parolee because he also volunteers at the center, had quadruple bypass in 2005. He was 57 years old and had a family history of heart disease.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyone who had a heart event should attend cardiac rehab because it gives you the secure feeling of knowing how to exercise,&rdquo; Andrews said. &ldquo;Being a part of the Grateful Undead has also given me an enjoyable social life that otherwise I might not have had.</p><p>&ldquo;When you have health problems that come up, you can talk about it and they understand. We are all getting old and falling apart. We thought we were all invincible, but we are not.&rdquo;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>As a veteran of the Army&rsquo;s elite Special Forces, Mike Shad was schooled in the art of reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. Those skills served him well when he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer at the age of 50.</p><p>From the moment he received his cancer diagnosis to the day he decided on a precise course of action, Shad, a Jacksonville native and a well-known area car dealer, embarked on a one-man mission to find a cure.</p><p>&ldquo;I was on a tear to figure this out. I was confident there had to be a solution out there,&rdquo; said Shad in an interview at <a href=\"http://www.baptistmdanderson.com\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center&nbsp;</a>in Jacksonville. &ldquo;You just have to keep searching until you find it. It never occurred to me that this would get me.&rdquo;</p><p>When Shad was diagnosed in 1997, prostate cancer was reaching epidemic proportions in the U.S. At that time, the American Cancer Society estimated that more than 300,000 Americans would be diagnosed with the disease, and, of those, more than 40,000 would die from it.</p><p>Not wanting to become a statistic himself, Shad, a former Army captain who served a tour of duty in Vietnam with the 5th Special Forces Group, took charge of his destiny. He educated himself on the disease and sought out the best doctors in the country who were working on the frontlines of research.</p><p>&ldquo;I learned that the premier prostate cancer surgeon in the country was Dr. Patrick Walsh, who had written a book on the subject,&rdquo; recalled Shad, who was hoping his cancer hadn&#39;t spread to his lymph nodes.</p><p>&ldquo;[Walsh] had an incredible batting average and the reason for that was because he was very selective with his patients. He wouldn&rsquo;t schedule surgery until he knew for certain that the cancer had not gotten out.&rdquo;</p><p>But tissue samples confirmed the worse. Shad&rsquo;s cancer had already spread to his lymph nodes, meaning there was no use operating to remove his prostate.</p><p>&ldquo;A surgeon told me, &lsquo;There is nothing we can do. There is no cure. We can alleviate the pain when you get it, but that&rsquo;s really all we can do,&#39;&quot; Shad recalled.</p><p>Unconvinced, Shad, who had built one of the top Ford dealerships in the country from the ground up, sought out more opinions. Unfortunately, no one could refute what Dr. Walsh had concluded: Shad had basically been given his death notice.</p><p>A certified public accountant with an MBA, Shad turned to an unlikely source for help: convicted felon Michael Milken, who served two years in a federal prison for violating U.S. Securities laws. Like Shad, Milken had been diagnosed with inoperable prostate cancer, but the former Wall Street billionaire was successfully treated for the disease in Beverly Hills.</p><p>&ldquo;When he was getting out of jail, he had a physical, and it turned out that he had prostate cancer,&rdquo; recalled Shad, who got in touch with Milken through another prostate cancer survivor, former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole.</p><p>&ldquo;Then Milken&rsquo;s urologist called me and said MD Anderson was the place to go.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"u-size1of2 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" alt=\"Mike Shad\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1522268300/Juice/JW2b_Mike_Shad.jpg\"></div><p>The first person Shad saw at MD Anderson was Andy von Eschenbach, MD, then head of the Urologic Oncology Department. Dr. Von Eschenbach specialized in prostate cancer, the disease that had taken his own father&rsquo;s life at age 65. He asked one of his MD Anderson associates, Chris Logothetis, MD, to meet with Shad to discuss an experimental treatment option Dr. Logothetis had developed.</p><p>&ldquo;Prior to that time, prostate cancer did not respond well to chemotherapy,&rdquo; said Shad.</p><p>Shad started chemotherapy in the spring of 1997, and later underwent surgery to remove his prostate and lymph nodes. Seven months after surgery, he flew back to Houston, where tests revealed no signs of the disease. But Shad is quick to point out that he has not been cured.</p><p>&ldquo;It comes back, as demonstrated by a rising PSA [blood test],&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s treated with hormone ablation. Dr. Logothetis says that this intermittent treatment has changed the cancer from a potentially fatal disease to a chronic one.&rdquo;</p><p>Since Shad&rsquo;s initial diagnosis in the late 1990s, evolutions in prostate cancer care have continued, according to<a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/urologist/dr-seth-strope-md\">&nbsp;Seth Strope, MD,&nbsp;</a>head of urologic oncology at Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center. Docetaxel chemotherapy has become a mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer, especially cancer that has gone to the bones. Many men with cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes are treated with androgen therapy and radiation, or surgery with extended lymph node dissection to try to cure their disease, Dr. Strope added.</p><p>Not long after getting the thumbs up from MD Anderson, Shad gave his first of what would be numerous speeches on the importance of prostate cancer screenings. He even hosted a forum on the topic in Jacksonville.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how many people have called me to ask for some advice. I occasionally still get calls,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Shad isn&rsquo;t shy about discussing what may have caused his cancer. During the Vietnam War, he served a combat tour as a Special Forces team leader in the Mekong Delta, a flat flood plain that was drenched with the infamous defoliate Agent Orange.</p><p>&ldquo;If you were in-country, you were deemed to have been exposed to Agent Orange,&rdquo; said Shad, who served in the Delta from December 1968 to November 1969. &ldquo;We would fly around an area called the Tram Forest, which was kind of like the Everglades. That place was heavily sprayed with Agent Orange and I was on the ground in there for months.&rdquo;</p><p>Recently, Shad was diagnosed with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, which, according to the Veterans Administration, has been associated with exposure to Agent Orange. Prominent Vietnam veterans such as Colin Powell and John Kerry are prostate cancer survivors. When retired Army general Norman Schwarzkopf was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1994 at Tampa&rsquo;s MacDill Air Force Base, he immediately launched into full battle mode.</p><p>&ldquo;For me, it was like war,&rdquo; said Schwarzkopf, who died of unrelated causes in 2012. &ldquo;First thing you do is learn about the enemy.&rdquo;</p><p>Shad said notable prostate cancer patients, including the late Arnold Palmer and former World Series manager Joe Torre, have helped bring survivorship out into the open.</p><p>&ldquo;Talking about it saves lives,&rdquo; said Shad, who has a CT scan and a bone scan every year at MD Anderson.</p><p>&ldquo;I have two sons who are in their 40s. If you have a family history, that&rsquo;s when you start getting checked. The earlier the diagnosis, the more options you have.&rdquo;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Married almost 50 years in June, Joe Cawley and his wife, Margie, enjoy taking long walks and doing water aerobics several times a week.</p><p>But Cawley, 74, started feeling tired and short of breath early last year. In May, when he was in <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-south\">Baptist Medical Center South</a> for a gastrointestinal procedure doctors determined he needed his heart valve replaced.</p><p>He turned to Baptist Heart Specialists. His cardiologist Shannon Leu, MD, referred him to <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/interventional-cardiologist/dr-ruby-satpathy-md\">Ruby Satpathy,</a> MD, interventional cardiologist and director of the Structural Heart program at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville.</a></p><p>There were two options: open heart surgery to replace the damaged valve, or a minimally invasive procedure known as Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement, or TAVR. &nbsp;But given Cawley&rsquo;s age and other chronic conditions, the heart valve team decided he would be better served with TAVR.</p><p>The procedure is designed for people with severe aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aortic valve) who are high and intermediate risk candidates for open heart surgery. Performed through the femoral artery in the groin, TAVR allows physicians to replace the aortic valve without opening the chest and without using a heart-lung machine.</p><p>Cawley was the first patient in November to have TAVR performed without general anesthesia. Dr. Satpathy uses conscious sedation or twilight sleep similar to what is used for colonoscopies, endoscopies and heart catheterization procedures.</p><p>Conscious sedation allows patients to recover more quickly as opposed to general anesthesia where they are intubated and on a breathing machine.</p><p>&ldquo;Patients are very comfortable. It&rsquo;s just like going to sleep and waking up,&rdquo; Dr. Satpathy said. &ldquo;Patients don&rsquo;t have the side effects of anesthesia and are not sleepy afterwards and they are walking four to five hours after surgery.&rdquo;</p><p>Cawley, who has had other back and joint replacement surgeries, said he liked the idea of not being on general anesthesia.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought if I didn&rsquo;t have to have all that anesthesia running through my system, I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m game, let&rsquo;s do it,&rsquo;&rdquo; Cawley recalled. &nbsp;&ldquo;It was the most fascinating thing I&rsquo;ve ever experienced in my life other than my wedding 50 years ago and the subsequent birth of our two daughters. I was even conversing with the anesthesiologist. I didn&rsquo;t feel anything and I went home the next day.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Satpathy and her team also use what she calls a &ldquo;magic stitch.&rdquo; A small hole is made in the femoral artery to perform TAVR and the Perclose/ ProGlide&reg; instrument delivers a suture to close the hole without cutting into the groin.</p><p>Cawley, a retired software development executive, author and commercial pilot, said he had total confidence in his team. &ldquo;The doctors were wonderful people. Everything went exactly as they told me. Their approach was very comforting and reassuring. I had no doubts whatsoever that I was going to have a positive outcome.&rdquo;</p><p>Baptist Medical Center is the only center in Jacksonville doing TAVR with conscious sedation and no groin incision. Most important, the procedure reduces a patient&rsquo;s hospital stay to one or two days.</p><p>Cawley&rsquo;s surgery was performed by a heart team which included Dr. Satpathy; Salvatore DiLoreto, MD, interventional cardiologist; and Robert Still, MD, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Baptist.</p><p>&ldquo;I went by to see him about five hours after he left the operating room and he was sitting up in the chair. &nbsp;He looked like a million dollars,&rdquo; Dr. DiLoreto said. &nbsp;&ldquo;He looked like he was at a spa ready to get his massage. It&rsquo;s hard to fathom that he just had his heart valve replaced. This is a tremendous asset because getting general anesthesia can be a shock to your system when you are older and can take several days to completely recover.&rdquo;</p><p>Cawley said he&rsquo;s feeling much better and ready to resume his routine. He&rsquo;s finishing cardiac rehab at Baptist Medical Center Beaches, calling team members there &ldquo;wonderful, caring and dedicated.&rdquo;</p><p>He is also thankful to gastroenterologist Buffie Reid, MD, who collaborated with Baptist Heart Specialists prior to his heart procedure.</p><p>At his follow-up appointment with Dr. Satpathy, he joked about taking a quick run down the hall. He was doing so well that he got the green light to graduate rehab a little early.</p><p>Water aerobics and walks with his wife are next on his to-do list.</p>",

The fourth group served as the control with those patients receiving the general standard of care provided to all patients, including education about their upcoming procedure. All four groups attended the hospital&rsquo;s preoperative Joint Camp where their baseline measurements were collected and interventions and related tools were provided.</p><p>The guided imagery group received an MP3 player with a surgery-specific script which included key details of what the &ldquo;day of surgery&rdquo; would be like, allowing patients to mentally prepare for the procedure and were guided through a series of controlled breathing techniques to help trigger the relaxation response. The biofeedback group received a portable unit which measures heart rate variability and was trained on how to achieve a state of physiological coherence (heart-brain synchrony). The combined group used the first two techniques simultaneously as part of their preoperative intervention. Finally, the standard care control group received the same preoperative education as those in the intervention groups, plus a brief introduction to breathing techniques for pain management.</p><p>&ldquo;What we found out was that by combining guided imagery and biofeedback, patients used less pain medication all the way around,&rdquo; said<a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/orthopedic-surgeon/dr-steven-lancaster-md\">&nbsp;Steven Lancaster, MD,</a> an orthopedic surgeon with the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/jacksonville-orthopaedic-institute\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</a>. &ldquo;This is something that all the anesthesiologists and surgeons are probably going to continue to use to try and get away from the big pain meds such as morphine that make the patients so groggy.</p><p>&ldquo;Mind-body research has shown a direct correlation between heightened stress and compromised immune function,&rdquo; said the study&#39;s principal researcher, Lisa E. Grossman, PhD, who has treated wounded soldiers and veterans transitioning back into the civilian world. &ldquo;Guided imagery gives patients the opportunity to mentally rehearse what they are going to encounter the day of surgery, reducing the fear of the unknown.&rdquo;</p><p>Added Dr. Lancaster, an orthopedic surgeon for more than 30 years: &ldquo;A lot of people are more inclined these days to use less post-operative narcotics, and that kind of alternative complementary medicine fits right in with us.

Injuries can be a big issue for these athletes because it affects not only their ability to compete and earn a living, but it also adversely affects their ability to take care of themselves,&rdquo; said Dr. Yorio, who has served on two USTA committees and is a team physician for the NFL&rsquo;s Jacksonville Jaguars.</p><p>&ldquo;Wheelchair tennis athletes have a different tennis stroke, biomechanically, than able-bodied players.

A few years ago, Paul, then director of security at First Baptist Church of Jacksonville, invited Davis, a decorated World War II and Korea War veteran, to lay a Memorial Day wreath at the downtown church.</p><p>At the time, Davis, a former grand marshal of the Jacksonville Veterans Day parade, was reportedly the oldest living veteran in Jacksonville. The 98-year-old Jacksonville resident once told a reporter that the secret to his longevity was a &ldquo;twice-daily drink of apple cider vinegar.&rdquo; A widower twice over with no children, Davis lived on his own until he suffered a debilitating fall in 2016. In April 2017, he was transported to Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville&rsquo;s emergency center with breathing problems.</p><p>A few days later, Paul received a call from a nurse at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-heart-hospital\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Jacksonville&rsquo;s Heart Hospital</a>. The nurse knew of Paul&rsquo;s deep affinity for fellow Marines and asked if he would pay a visit to Mr. Davis&rsquo; room.</p><p>Paul put on his dress blue Marine uniform emblazoned with sergeant stripes and visited Davis for a few hours. The retired master sergeant and combat veteran could not summon the energy to speak, but, according to Paul, shed a tear when he recognized a fellow Marine in his room. When Davis was gently loaded into the back of an ambulance, Paul performed a ceremonial slow-motion salute, holding the salute until the ambulance was out of eyesight.</p><p>Those who witnessed Paul&rsquo;s dignified sendoff for a fellow Marine were emotionally moved. Afterwards, Paul wiped the tears from his eyes, changed into his black security uniform and reported for work. A short time later, he received a call informing him that Davis, a veteran of three historic battles in the Pacific, including Guadalcanal and Okinawa, and two Korean War campaigns, had passed away en route to a hospice.</p><p>&ldquo;That touched me,&rdquo; said Paul, a combat-wounded veteran of the Vietnam War and a Bronze Star and Purple Heart recipient born on Nov. 10, the Marine Corps&rsquo; birthday. &ldquo;Knowing he was dying, I did what any other Marine would have done. It was an honor for me to give the final salute to an American hero.&rdquo;</p>",

A few years later, the hard-charging TV reporter found out her heart was in a constant state of misfire.</p><p>But those health scares were mere blips on the radar compared to the day when Robach found out she had breast cancer.</p><p>The award-winning news anchor of ABC&rsquo;s Good Morning America chronicles her difficult but illuminating 12-month journey to survivor status in her 2015 book, &quot;Better: How I Let Go of Control, Held On to Hope, and Found Joy in My Darkest Hour.&rdquo;</p><p>A self-admitted &ldquo;workaholic,&rdquo; the best-selling author, who was a keynote speaker at the 2016 Good for You Girls&#39; Day Out event in Jacksonville, didn&rsquo;t let anything slow her down as she climbed the ladder from morning traffic reporter to national correspondent. Then, at the age of 40, she was diagnosed with breast cancer.</p><p>&ldquo;My self-worth was tied to my job. It defined me beyond the point of healthiness,&rdquo; Robach writes in her revealing, 256-page memoir. &ldquo;When I was diagnosed, I felt my sunny outlook had been stolen.&rdquo;</p><p>When Robach agreed to have her first mammogram on national TV, she was buoyed by the fact that there was no history of breast cancer in her family. To her surprise, the test revealed a malignant tumor on her right breast. Her doctor removed 13 of her lymph nodes before he found a second tumor. She immediately underwent a bilateral mastectomy, followed by six months of chemotherapy treatments.</p><p>&ldquo;Turns out I was the poster child for mastectomy, but no one knew it ahead of time, because my lymph nodes &lsquo;looked&rsquo; normal in the sonogram and my tumor seemed isolated,&rdquo; recounts Robach, a recipient of the End Cancer Award from <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center.</a></p><p>A Michigan native who moved to Georgia when she was 12, Robach volunteered at nursing homes as a teenager and was a high school beauty queen when she went off to college to study broadcast journalism at the University of Georgia. Inspired by an aunt who worked as a TV anchor in Tennessee, she fell in love with reporting while working for a campus station.</p><p>&ldquo;It was an honor to tell people&rsquo;s stories and capture their unscripted moments,&rdquo; she adds in the book.</p><p>After her third of eight chemo treatments, Robach, who spent nine years at NBC, including six as a weekend anchor for Today, boarded a plane to cover the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia. It was her way of &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; the cancer that had &ldquo;ravaged&rdquo; so much of her identity.&nbsp;</p><p>But being a cancer survivor didn&rsquo;t dawn on her until she took a much-needed family vacation to Tuscany, following reconstructive surgery.</p><p>On a warm and lazy July afternoon just outside the picturesque town of Siena, Robach ran along the rolling countryside, past lush, sun-splashed vineyards, until something stopped her dead in her tracks.</p><p>Placing her hands on her knees, Robach said she realized that she wasn&rsquo;t just running, she was &ldquo;running on a new path, a path that had a real future.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was completely caught off guard. I actually forgot all that I had been through this year,&rdquo; the book says. &ldquo;Emotion flooded me, but as I fought back tears, I felt empowered. I would never be the beaten-down, hopeless cancer patient I&rsquo;d often felt like over the last eight months. I was a survivor. In that instant, I had hope and a vision of what I could still become.&rdquo;</p><p>Now that she has &ldquo;looked beyond the veil,&rdquo; Robach said she hears a clock ticking in her head. She&rsquo;s on a mission to spread the word about the benefits of early detection. When you have walked through the valley of the shadow of death as she has, there is no turning back - only a path going forward.</p>",

Schullo came up with the idea of starting a dialogue about heart disease &ndash; the No. 1 killer among Americans, and congenital heart defects, the most common type of birth defect in the country &ndash; by using a little red beanie as a conversation piece. &ldquo;You are reaching not only the mom, but also the grandmother, the siblings, etc.,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was looking for something volunteers could do in the comfort of their own home on a year-round basis.&rdquo;</p><p>The national campaign, which began at one Chicago hospital in February 2014, has grown to more than 460 hospitals, nationwide.</p><p>Little Hats, Big Hearts honors the memory of Schullo&rsquo;s childhood friend Courtney Lynn Ksepka, a former medical economics analyst who died unexpectedly of a heart arrhythmia at age 25. &ldquo;We knew each other since kindergarten. We even shared the same birthday,&rdquo; said Schullo, who started volunteering for the heart association not long after Courtney&rsquo;s untimely death in 2008.</p><p>Lori Strange-Paylor, the senior director of the Jacksonville AHA office, said the initiative spoke to her on a personal level. &ldquo;Because heart disease runs in my family, the fear of getting pregnant was overwhelming,&rdquo; said Strange-Paylor, who underwent a high-risk pregnancy at age 41. &ldquo;The nurses and staff at Baptist were amazing through the whole process. So, when it came time to choosing a partner for Little Hats, Big Hearts, Baptist Health was a natural choice.&rdquo;</p><p>Strange-Paylor individually packaged the nearly 600 red hats that came through her office. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all hand-made and not stamped by a machine,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Baptist Health personalized them by inserting a Dear Mommy card into each package with tips on ways to take care of her heart.&rdquo;</p><p>The Deercreek trio fancy 100 percent acrylic yarn.

Julia prefers ribbing.&rdquo;</p><p>Tomka&rsquo;s crocheted red hats are easily identified by their &ldquo;finished edges,&rdquo; some in the shape of scallops.</p><p>All three women are very active within their residential community, but they don&rsquo;t consider themselves &ldquo;professional do-gooders,&rdquo; according to Tomka.</p><p>Added Curtin, who has been cancer free for the past eight years: &ldquo;We just consider ourselves truly blessed.&rdquo;</p><p><br></p><p><em>For more information on Little Hats Big Hearts,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Affiliate/Little-Hats-Big-Hearts_UCM_487734_SubHomePage.jsp\" target=\"_blank\"><em>click here</em></a></p>",

Not so long ago, she wasn&rsquo;t even sure she&rsquo;d live long enough to join the weeklong cruise she and her family have taken to various countries over the past 20 years.</p><p>In the fall of 2015, doctors discovered two giant aneurysms, a whopping 33 millimeters and 26 millimeters in size, compressing her left optic nerve. Vision problems in her left eye led to scans that revealed the aneurysms&mdash;weak or thin spots on blood vessels in the brain that balloon and fill with blood.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew two people who suffered from ruptured brain aneurysms and saw how they struggled after the aneurysms burst. They had difficulty getting back to living normal lives,&rdquo; said Baker, 58.</p><p>The vivacious assistant retail manager, who loves meeting new people and lives by the motto that &ldquo;nobody is a stranger,&rdquo; was determined not to suffer a similar fate. She had too much dancing and cruising left in her.</p><p>Baker&rsquo;s primary care doctor referred her to <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-ricardo-hanel-md\">Ricardo Hanel,</a> MD, PhD, neurovascular surgeon with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/lyerly-neurosurgery\">Lyerly Neurosurgery&nbsp;</a>and director of the Baptist Neurological Institute at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>.</p><p>Dr. Hanel treated her brain aneurysms in October 2015 using an FDA-approved, innovative, minimally invasive technology called the Pipeline&trade; Flex embolization device, specifically designed for large or giant, &quot;wide-necked&quot; unruptured brain aneurysms.</p><p>Delivered through her groin up to her brain, the device implants a braided cylindrical mesh tube across the neck of the aneurysm. It redirects blood flow away from the aneurysm and provides a scaffold to reconstruct and heal the vessel.</p><p>&quot;The Pipeline device is simply a breakthrough in neurovascular surgery in how we treat patients with unruptured brain aneurysms,&quot; said Dr. Hanel. &quot;The ability to address large and giant, wide-necked aneurysms with minimally invasive methods is a valuable advancement in how we treat aneurysms today.</p><p>&ldquo;Several years ago, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been imaginable to treat complex brain cases such as Rhonda&rsquo;s without open brain surgery and with such successful results.&rdquo;</p><p>The Brain Aneurysm Foundation estimates that 6 million people in the United States suffer from unruptured brain aneurysms&mdash;that&rsquo;s one in every 50 people. A brain aneurysm ruptures every 18 minutes and ruptured aneurysms are fatal in about 40 percent of cases.</p><p>A follow-up procedure in September to treat a smaller aneurysm on the right side of her brain showed that both of Baker&rsquo;s giant aneurysms have completely healed.</p><p>That was music to Baker&rsquo;s ears. Not only did it mean she&rsquo;d make her October cruise, but she could go back to living life with fewer worries. And living she does, whether line dancing with her sister or cooking her comfort soul foods&mdash;ribs, collard greens and turkey wings.</p><p>She&rsquo;s now making sure everyone she meets hears two messages: Listen to your body, and live life to the fullest.</p><p>&ldquo;If something doesn&rsquo;t feel right, don&rsquo;t ignore it. Get it checked and see a health care professional,&rdquo; Baker said.</p><p>Since the aneurysm damaged her optic nerve, she still can&rsquo;t see well out of her left eye. But being alive is all that matters, she said.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m blessed to be alive,&rdquo; Baker said. &ldquo;You only live once and tomorrow is not promised. You go and have a good time because I&rsquo;m going to have a good time. You may not wake up in the morning so go ahead and do what you do&mdash;live.&rdquo;</p>",

Hanel,</a> MD, PhD, neurovascular surgeon with Baptist Health and <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/lyerly-neurosurgery\">Lyerly Neurosurgery&nbsp;</a>and director of the Baptist Neurological Institute. <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-eric-sauvageau-md\">Eric Sauvageau,</a> MD, neurovascular surgeon and director of the Baptist Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center, was also a co-author and co-investigator on the study.</p><p>&ldquo;This study shows the benefit of this breakthrough technology for smaller aneurysms. It demonstrates that the Pipeline &trade; Embolization Device is a safe and effective way of dealing with under 12 millimeter aneurysms,&rdquo; Dr. Hanel said. &ldquo;The good thing about the pipeline device is once the aneurysm is closed off and treated, the patient is cured, which is very empowering.</p><p>&ldquo;The Pipeline is likely more durable and, in the hands of experienced operators like the ones in the study, has low complication rates,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>A cerebral aneurysm (also known as an intracranial aneurysm) is a weak or thin spot on a blood vessel in the brain that balloons out and fills with blood.</p><p>The Pipeline, a braided cylindrical mesh known as a flow diverter, is inserted through a microcatheter into an artery in the groin. The device is then threaded through the body to the brain to slow the flow of blood into the aneurysm and allow the diseased vessel to heal.</p><p>The Pipeline is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for adults with large aneurysms (which are greater than 12 mm). The results of the clinical trial could open up the procedure for use on patients with small- and medium-sized, wide-necked, unruptured aneurysms, which make up the majority of the cases.</p><p>&quot;This study confirms that flow diversion is a valid alternative to complement our existing techniques to fix brain aneurysms,&rdquo; Dr. Sauvageau said.</p><p>PATIENTS GRATEFUL TO BE ALIVE</p><p>Twenty-two sites in the United States and one in Canada participated in the PREMIER study and 141 patients, including 21 from Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville, which had the highest number enrolled.</p><p>The study found that a high rate of aneurysms were completely healed at the one-year follow up, with no cases of recurrence. There were also no incidents of aneurysms rupturing one year after the procedure. These results will be submitted to the FDA for review.</p><p>Dana Bean, of Fernandina Beach, was one of the first to participate in the study; Kristine Meyer, from Mandarin, was the last. Both had successful treatment and surgery at the Baptist Neurological Institute and the Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville and Lyerly Neurosurgery.</p><p>Bean, now 54, had lived with a small, hard-to-reach brain aneurysm for six years. It was in the exact spot as the aneurysm that took her mother&rsquo;s life when Bean was just 6. Her mother collapsed on the playground, as Bean and her brothers played nearby. An ambulance came and she never saw her mother again.</p><p>She used to wake up in the middle of the night worrying that her aneurysm would burst. In 2014, she became just the second person in the world to be part of the Pipeline clinical trial. At her two-year follow up this past fall, Bean described life without the aneurysm.</p><p>&ldquo;Before I worried about dying or being a burden to other people,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wanted to be here for graduations, weddings and new babies and the future. Now that I&rsquo;m cured, I know to seize every day. I live every day to the fullest and I&rsquo;m excited about the future.&rdquo;</p><p>The 42-year-old Meyer worried that her brain aneurysm would burst while driving in her car, with her young children in the back seat. &nbsp;She had the Pipeline procedure in November 2015. Last October, she learned that her aneurysm was gone after shrinking over time. &ldquo;That was the best Thanksgiving gift I could have received. I don&rsquo;t have to live with that fear anymore of what could go wrong,&rdquo; Meyer said.</p><p>More than a year earlier, she had been experiencing numbness in her arm, dizziness and headaches, which led to the discovery of her aneurysm. &ldquo;My equilibrium was off, which wasn&rsquo;t the norm for me. I felt like something was wrong,&rdquo; Meyer said.</p><p>The aneurysm was in a difficult location behind her eye and nose, and Meyer said she didn&rsquo;t want to risk any complications from other more invasive brain surgeries. Using the Pipeline, Dr. Hanel was able to reach the aneurysm and redirect the blood flow away from the aneurysm. The commercial real estate broker was home the next day and was back to work in just two weeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Hanel really took time explaining the procedure and answering questions with not only me, but my husband and mother. We never felt rushed,&rdquo; Meyer said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was excited I had the opportunity to participate [in the study], otherwise I would have had to live with it and not know if and/or when it was going to rupture.&rdquo;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Working as a nurse on the neuro critical care unit at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville,</a> Linda Shriner knew the symptoms of stroke well. So she knew something was wrong last November when she started slurring her words while talking with a patient.</p><p>&ldquo;I went to talk to a patient and the words I wanted to say were not coming out of my mouth correctly,&rdquo; Shriner said. &ldquo;I went back to the nurse&rsquo;s station and sat down. I started getting a headache on the left side and my vision was blurry.&rdquo;</p><p>The symptoms subsided, but the 51-year-old went to the emergency room to follow up. She was admitted to the hospital for several scans and tests. Doctors discovered she had a hole in her heart that may have led to a transient ischemic attack, or TIA, also known as a mini-stroke.</p><p>The hole in Shriner&rsquo;s heart is known as a Patent Foramen Ovale, or PFO. Everyone is born with this small hole between the upper chambers of the heart, which typically closes soon after birth.</p><p>But in one in four cases, the hole remains open. Not everyone has adverse health effects, but the larger the hole, the more likely the complications. And if there is blood moving from the right atrium to the left through the hole (without getting filtered in the lungs) that contains a blood clot, it could travel to the brain and cause a stroke.</p><p>Shriner was referred to <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/interventional-cardiologist/dr-ruby-satpathy-md\">Ruby Satpathy</a>, MD, interventional cardiologist at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-heart-specialists\">Baptist Heart Specialists&nbsp;</a>and the first in northeast Florida to treat the problem with a new FDA approved device called the Amplatzer &trade; PFO Occluder. Dr. Satpathy threads the self-expandable, double disc device through a catheter via the groin up to the heart, then slowly expands it through the hole. The two discs then cover the hole.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to close the hole in appropriately selective patients (especially young patients with large holes) to keep strokes from recurring. I run screening tests to make sure the patient doesn&rsquo;t have any other reasons for their stroke,&rdquo; said Dr. Satpathy, who is director of <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/heart-vascular-care/structural-heart-program\">Baptist Health&rsquo;s Structural Heart&nbsp;</a>program.</p><p>Shriner, who has worked as a nurse at Baptist Health for 15 years, was grateful the hole was detected and closed. All she could think about until her procedure was having another larger stroke and not surviving or being partially disabled.</p><p>She rotates working as nurse at various Baptist Health hospitals but had spent most of the previous eight months on the neuro critical care unit at Baptist Jacksonville.</p><p>&ldquo;I could have been debilitated and never able to function again,&rdquo; Shriner said. &ldquo;I think if I didn&rsquo;t have any kind of experience in nursing, I would have never known what was happening and would have ignored the symptoms.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Satpathy agreed. &nbsp;Shriner&rsquo;s experience as a nurse was an advantage to seek help sooner rather than later as well as working with people who also knew the warning signs, she said.</p><p>Over the years, Shriner said she&rsquo;s had echocardiograms and stress tests, but the hole never showed up until a specialized test that looked into her heart was performed.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been short of breath growing up if I ran down the driveway, but I thought everybody was like that,&rdquo; said Shriner, of Green Cove Springs, who with her husband has three grown children and five grandchildren.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel great now. I&rsquo;m so thankful that I will be able to participate in my children and grandchildren&rsquo;s lives without fear that a stroke could end it at any moment. Hopefully, this [procedure] will help other people.&rdquo;</p>",

Don&rsquo;t tell anyone, but I would do it for free,&rsquo;&rdquo; Dr. Pezzi recalled. &ldquo;He genuinely was so happy. It really impacted me.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Pezzi went on to share that story with his younger students and what he also learned from his father, who was a surgeon, and his mother, a primary care physician.</p><p>Today, after a 27-year career in oncology surgery, it seems that life has come full circle.</p><p>Dr. Pezzi was named in early 2017 as head of the Division of Surgery and surgeon-in-chief of<a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\">&nbsp;Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center.</a> He returns to work with that same surgeon who inspired him, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/thoracic-surgeon/dr-joe-putnam-jr-md\">Bill Putnam,</a> MD, medical director at Baptist MD Anderson.</p><p>&ldquo;This is an amazing, once in a lifetime opportunity to help build something special and new,&rdquo; said Dr. Pezzi, 57. &ldquo;MD Anderson has a special place in my heart and now I get the opportunity to be part of MD Anderson again.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Putnam was himself a young surgeon when he began working with doctors in training at MD Anderson. He remembers that time fondly and over the years has worked with Dr. Pezzi co-authoring articles for various cancer publications.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Pezzi has had a long successful career as a surgical oncologist and has the right combination of skills we need,&rdquo; Dr. Putnam said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a hard-wired optimistic with a very nice manner about him.</p><p>&ldquo;He listens to people and tries to seek understanding first, which are important qualities to ensure success of our program,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the type of surgeon who can combine the surgical care that is needed with compassion for the individual patient.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Pezzi brings his extensive skills to Northeast Florida after more than 8,600 cancer surgeries at Abington Hospital-Jefferson Health in Pennsylvania, where he served as director of surgical oncology and associate program director for the General Surgery Residency Program.</p><p>As surgeon-in-chief at Baptist MD Anderson, Dr. Pezzi will oversee the quality of surgical care and enhance research opportunities in collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center. Dr. Pezzi will also recruit additional surgeons and create a future training and fellowship program for new physicians.</p><p>In addition to his administrative responsibilities, he will perform cancer surgery in his areas of expertise: breast, melanoma and thyroid cancers. He will also treat patients with abdominal tumors such as colon, liver, and pancreas, and more uncommon tumors such as gastric cancers and sarcomas.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Pezzi&rsquo;s many years of oncologic surgical experience will play a vital role in supporting us in our mission of growing programs such as melanoma treatment that are needed here in Jacksonville,&rdquo; said Darin Roark, vice president of oncology services for Baptist Health. Skin cancers are the fifth highest type of diagnosed cancer nationally.</p><p>Dr. Pezzi, who received his surgical oncology fellowship training from MD Anderson and his general surgery residency training at the Geisinger Medical Center in Pennsylvania, has seen throughout his life the role surgery and medicine can play.</p><p>His father was a general surgeon, and one brother is a gastroenterologist. His other brother is a general surgeon like himself. His daughter and wife are also nurses and his son is in medical school. Most rewarding about his time in Pennsylvania, Dr. Pezzi said, was seeing his patients grow older and watching those patients&rsquo; children and grandchildren grow up.</p><p>&ldquo;My dad always said surgery and medicine is a noble profession because you are helping other people,&rdquo; Dr. Pezzi said. &ldquo;Surgeons are often the first person people with cancer meet. It&rsquo;s a very scary time in their life, but it&rsquo;s nice to give them a good operation and get rid of their cancer and watch them go on with their lives.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Pezzi said he believes in reaching out beyond the hospital walls, as he did with a team of physicians who went to Thailand and the Philippines after devastating tsunamis in 2005 and 2006. Being able to help people immediately in a short, safe, high quality operation, he said, is what motivates him.</p><p>&ldquo;Surgery is a great skill to take with you to other parts of the world,&rdquo; Dr. Pezzi said. &ldquo;You can change someone&rsquo;s life in an hour with a good operation.&rdquo;</p><p>He also has spent his career serving on national cancer boards and plans to continue working with the Commission on Cancer and the Society of Surgical Oncology in his new position at Baptist MD Anderson.</p><p>Baptist MD Anderson opened in October 2015 combining the strengths of Baptist Health Jacksonville, the largest health care system in Northeast Florida, and MD Anderson, the leading cancer program in the country. A new nine-story building is expected to open across from the existing location in mid-2018.</p><p>&ldquo;We are changing things within our community in a positive way for our patients,&rdquo; Dr. Putnam said. &ldquo;Dr. Pezzi will be a great ambassador for our program and for our community of surgeons and oncologists in Jacksonville.&rdquo;</p>",

I was completely paralyzed on the left side.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Rentz, 66, was afraid he would die right there. Then he remembered the signs of stroke and reacted quickly. With his right hand, he picked up his cell phone from a cup holder in his truck and dialed 911. When the 911 operator asked him what his emergency was, Rentz managed to get one word out &ndash; stroke.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember saying a prayer in the truck while waiting for the rescue unit,&rdquo; recalled Rentz, who is married with two grown children. When paramedics arrived, Rentz was barely able to pronounce the name of the school where his wife works.</p><p>Paramedics on the scene recognized that Rentz had suffered a severe stroke and drove him to a nearby helicopter pad.

Stroke is one of the highest causes of long-term, serious disability in the nation.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Hanel was telling me what a miracle I was that I had enough function to call 911. The Lord put my phone where I could get to it and the rescue unit and helicopter did their job so well,&rdquo; said Rentz, a U.S. Navy veteran who is retired from a container manufacturing plant.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s amazing they could pull a clot out of my head without major surgery.

It was really bad,&rdquo; said Tatarka, now 52.</p><p>Tatarka has always loved to dance, spending five days a week in Zumba and other high-energy dance classes for fun and exercise. The pain in her knees threatened to bring that part of her life to a halt.</p><p>&ldquo;Over time, I had to wear knee braces to keep my knee caps in place and it became more and more painful,&rdquo; Tatarka said. &ldquo;Everything was a challenge. When you&rsquo;re only 40, it makes it very difficult to lead a normal life.&rdquo;</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t travel with her husband or enjoy time with her three sons. Walking up and down stairs became impossible, and she&rsquo;d have to take elevators and escalators and avoid going places that required a lot of walking. Physical therapy, pain pills and cortisone shots provided no relief.</p><p>Then she found <a href=\"http://www.joionline.net/physicians/bio/steven_m._crenshaw_md/\">Steven M. Crenshaw,</a> MD, an orthopaedic surgeon with <a href=\"http://www.joionline.net/\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</a> who specializes in MAKOplasty &reg; Partial Knee Resurfacing.</p><p>The procedure is for people with early-to mid-stage osteoarthritis, in which only the diseased portion of the knee is replaced, sparing healthy bone and ligaments.</p><p>The robotic-assisted surgery allows surgeons to be more precise in aligning and positioning the implants, which helps them last longer.</p><p>The minimally invasive procedure provides more rapid relief from pain, a shorter hospital stay, a quicker return to daily activities and more natural knee function.</p><p>Using the system&rsquo;s software, doctors use a CT scan to create a 3D model of the patient&rsquo;s knee. From this model, a pre-surgical plan is developed for the positioning of implants based on the patient&rsquo;s unique anatomy.</p><p>The procedure &ldquo;can significantly improve the quality of life for patients whose osteoarthritis is not advanced enough for a total knee replacement but whose pain can no longer be controlled by medication and other non-surgical options,&quot; said Dr. Crenshaw, who was the first orthopaedic surgeon trained and certified in the procedure at Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</p><p>Tatarka&rsquo;s surgery was performed in January 2013, followed by rehab at the hospital&rsquo;s Joint Center.</p><p>Tatarka, who also took dance and ballet classes as a child, had both knees repaired at the same time. Within a few months, she was back dancing.</p><p>&ldquo;For me, MAKOplasty was a very good solution for what was ailing me with my knees,&rdquo; Tatarka said. &ldquo;MAKOplasty is so precise. They kept the good part of my knee and only replaced the diseased tissue.&rdquo;</p><p>Two year after her surgery, she celebrated her 50th birthday with a 10-day family trip to France, including time in Paris walking more than 20,000 steps each day.</p><p>&ldquo;I would have never been able to walk that if I didn&rsquo;t have my knees repaired. I was determined to get back to a normal walking life style and travel,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>She&rsquo;s also back to her normal routine with her children, which includes taking her youngest to school baseball games and games with his travel team. She also enjoys babysitting her 2-month old granddaughter.</p><p>And she&rsquo;s back to dancing, joining various classes in the area.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absolutely a blast,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Dancing takes your mind off everything else.&rdquo;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Katie Eunice keeps track of her sons&rsquo; medical appointments and treatments with a color-coded system in her calendar.</p><p>The calendar tells the story of the Adel, Georgia, family&rsquo;s journey by hospital and clinic visit in Jacksonville: red for <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.org\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>, orange for <a href=\"http://www.nemours.org\" target=\"_blank\">Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care&nbsp;</a>and blue for <a href=\"http://www.floridaproton.org\" target=\"_blank\">UF Health Proton Therapy Institute</a>.</p><p>Since Aaron and Andrew&rsquo;s dual diagnoses with brain tumors this past winter, the calendar provides a kind of stability in an otherwise hectic and frightening time.</p><p>It all started with a routine eye exam for Aaron on Dec. 22. As a teacher trying to squeeze everything her family needed into Christmas break, Eunice almost canceled it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a good thing she didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>The optometrist noticed right away that the normally healthy 10-year-old&rsquo;s optic nerves were swollen. She sent Aaron to a Valdosta hospital for a CT scan, which revealed a scary and unusual build-up of cerebrospinal fluid on the right side of Aaron&rsquo;s brain.</p><p>&ldquo;We knew then that something was wrong but didn&rsquo;t know what it meant,&rdquo; Eunice said.</p><p>The ER doctor called pediatric neurosurgeon <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-neurosurgeon/dr-philipp-aldana-md\" target=\"_blank\">Philipp Aldana, MD</a>, co-medical director of the <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/centers-of-distinction/neuroscience/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Walter and Michelle Stys Neuroscience Institute&nbsp;</a>at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. Dr. Aldana recommended that Aaron be transferred to Jacksonville for a full work-up. &ldquo;Our Kids Kare mobile ICU was dispatched to Georgia to get him here quickly and safely,&rdquo; Dr. Aldana said.</p><p>Six hours after the eye exam started, and within 30 minutes of arriving at the <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/programs-services/hospital-services/Pages/emergency.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson ER</a>, Dr. Aldana&rsquo;s physician&rsquo;s assistant Britney Popp had pulled up Aaron&rsquo;s scan. &ldquo;She told us that what we were seeing was likely a brain tumor because of the color difference,&rdquo; Eunice said. &ldquo;The fluid was darker gray and the tumor was lighter gray.&rdquo;</p><p>To get a better view of what was behind the fluid buildup, Dr. Aldana ordered an MRI. During the two-hour test, Aaron watched the movies &ldquo;X-Men&rdquo; and &ldquo;Grown Ups&rdquo; using special movie goggles built to withstand the MRI machine&rsquo;s strong magnet.</p><p>&ldquo;The MRI showed a cyst the size of a small cherry around Aaron&rsquo;s pituitary gland, topped by a smaller tumor,&rdquo; explained Dr. Aldana. &ldquo;Although benign, this type of mass is likely what was causing the optic nerve to swell.&rdquo;</p><p>In medical terms, it was a craniopharyngioma, a non-cancerous brain tumor found near the pituitary gland that can impact many functions of the brain, including hormone making, growth, and vision.</p><p>The family considered their options. Aaron could have surgery alone to completely remove the cyst and tumor, or a different surgery just to drain the cyst that would be followed by proton therapy, a type of radiation treatment that is highly targeted to avoid normal tissue while destroying the abnormal mass.</p><p>Sounding much older than his 10 years, Aaron explained, &ldquo;At first, Daddy was thinking I should have the big surgery, but Dr. Aldana told him there were too many risks, like I could go blind or it could affect my pituitary gland.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Aldana consulted with his neuro-oncology colleagues, including <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/radiation-oncologist/dr-daniel-indelicato-md\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Indelicato, MD</a>, director of the Pediatric Proton Therapy Program of the UF Health Proton Therapy Institute. They recommended draining the cyst at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s on Christmas Eve, followed by 30 proton therapy treatments over six weeks.</p><p>The family stayed at the <a href=\"https://rmhcjacksonville.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ronald McDonald House of Jacksonville&nbsp;</a>throughout Aaron&rsquo;s treatment. They knew they had a long journey ahead of them, but the prognosis was hopeful.</p><p>But that got Eunice thinking about her younger son Andrew, now 9.</p><p>&ldquo;In September, Andrew&rsquo;s doctor said he wasn&rsquo;t growing like he was supposed to be,&rdquo; Eunice said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always been in the 25th percentile, but he was fixing to fall off the growth chart.&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor sent Andrew to Tallahassee pediatric endocrinologist Nancy Wright, MD, who ordered extensive testing and scheduled a Dec. 23 appointment to discuss the results. &ldquo;My sister took him to the appointment because we were in the hospital with Aaron,&rdquo; Eunice recalled. &ldquo;Dr. Wright said Andrew&rsquo;s bone age was at 5 years old, his thyroid levels were low, and that he needed an MRI to look for a tumor on his pituitary gland.</p><p>&ldquo;I asked Dr. Aldana if Andrew could have the same tumor Aaron had. He said that a craniopharyngioma is rare and not usually hereditary. I told him, &lsquo;OK, but we might be back to see you!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Sure enough, they were. Andrew&rsquo;s MRI in Georgia on Dec. 31 revealed a growth that covered his pituitary gland, and the third grader was referred to Dr. Aldana. A more detailed, higher-resolution MRI and CT scan at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s all but confirmed the diagnosis: Andrew, too, had a craniopharyngioma. Because of its size and location in his brain, it could be removed surgically.</p><p>On Jan. 31, Dr. Aldana and Nemours pediatric otolaryngologist <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-otolaryngologist-ent/dr-gary-josephson-md\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Josephson, MD,</a> performed a minimally invasive procedure through Andrew&rsquo;s nasal cavity to remove 95 percent of the cyst. &ldquo;They told us he wouldn&rsquo;t have to go through radiation treatment like Aaron did, but would need an MRI every three months for the next two to three years to monitor him,&rdquo; Eunice said.</p><p>Craniopharyngiomas are rare, but the UF Health Proton Therapy Institute, in partnership with Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, has treated more than 200 children with these tumors in recent years &mdash; more than any other pediatric brain tumor program in the country, Dr. Indelicato said.</p><p>Throughout radiation, Aaron continued to play baseball and kept up with his schoolwork. And research suggests that children with craniopharyngiomas like Aaron&rsquo;s maintain academic achievement following proton therapy, something doctors rarely saw when children were treated with traditional radiation.</p><p>&ldquo;Aaron and Andrew are fine young men,&rdquo; Dr. Indelicato said. &ldquo;I look forward to watching them grow up and hearing about their accomplishments.&rdquo;</p><p>Jacksonville is fortunate to have a proton therapy center, Dr. Aldana said. The joint brain tumor program brings children and families from all over the country and the world to Jacksonville for specialized care.</p><p>&ldquo;We are so glad Aaron and Andrew are doing well following their treatment with us. They are delightful boys who have a good attitude toward the disease they have, and that has a lot to do with their parents,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are so positive in their thinking, and it&rsquo;s clear they really love their boys.&rdquo;</p><p>Juggling doctors&rsquo; appointments and treatments, and extended stays away from home, have become routine parts of the Eunice family&rsquo;s lives, which includes older brother Matthew. Lately, Katie Eunice has managed to add a few appointments to her calendar in pink, her favorite color, for classes she&rsquo;s taking to earn an advanced teaching certificate in graduate school in Americus, Ga.</p><p>As difficult as their journey has been, the family keeps the faith that helps them stay strong. &ldquo;Since the beginning, Aaron has said, &lsquo;God&rsquo;s got this!&rsquo;&rdquo; Eunice said. &ldquo;We know it&rsquo;s true and it helps us through our most challenging days because of his positivity, and Andrew&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>At age 14, Mandarin middle-schooler Jordan Mason is not your typical seventh grader.</p><p>For one, he towers over many of his classmates at 6 feet 2 inches tall and 240 pounds. But that&rsquo;s not what really sets the basketball-loving teen apart from others his age.</p><p>Earlier this year, Mason had a stroke and it paralyzed him.</p><p>But only for a few hours.</p><p>That&rsquo;s because he had time on his side, thanks to a quick-acting teacher who called 911, an accurate assessment by the pediatric emergency medicine physician at the <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/programs-services/hospital-services/Pages/emergency.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Emergency Center</a>, and the expertise of a <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/\">Baptist Health&nbsp;</a>endovascular neurosurgeon and the neurosurgery team at the <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/centers-of-distinction/neuroscience/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Stys Neuroscience Institute&nbsp;</a>at <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>.</p><p>It was Jan.13, 2017. Friday the 13th, to be exact.</p><p>&ldquo;Jordan had been complaining of heartburn and a headache and wanted to stay home from school, but I told him to go and I&rsquo;d come pick him up if he didn&rsquo;t feel better,&rdquo; said his mother, Donna Jackson-Chambliss.</p><p>&ldquo;At 10 am I got a call that he had fallen down and was complaining that his head was killing him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;His teacher had noticed that he was not himself and was slurring his words, so they called an ambulance.&rdquo;</p><p>Strokes happen for a few reasons, but Mason&rsquo;s was an ischemic stroke, caused from a blood clot that had formed in his heart, broken away and traveled to his brain. It&rsquo;s rare in children, but Mason was more susceptible because he was born with a heart condition.</p><p>When he arrived at the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Emergency Center, his caregiving team did not know about his heart history. Each year in the US, stroke only affects about 6 out of 100,000 children who are 15 or younger, so it might not have been a diagnosis that many emergency room physicians would consider.</p><p>&ldquo;Stroke is really one of the more difficult diagnoses to make in young patients because it&rsquo;s so low on the list,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/neurosurgeon/dr-eric-sauvageau-md\">Eric Sauvageau, MD</a>, director of the <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/brain-and-spine/stroke-and-cerebrovascular-care\">Baptist Stroke &amp; Cerebrovascular Center</a>, and Mason&rsquo;s neurovascular surgeon. &ldquo;It would have been easy for the pediatric emergency room doctor to brush it off but he was at the top of his game, and recognized that it could be a stroke.&rdquo;</p><p>After reviewing Mason&rsquo;s CT and MRI scans, Dr. Sauvageau confirmed that a clot was blocking the right internal carotid artery, and that a good portion of the brain matter on that side was dying from the lack of blood flow.</p><p>&ldquo;They told me that they needed to take Jordan back to surgery right away,&rdquo; Jackson-Chambliss recalled. &ldquo;At that point he couldn&rsquo;t move his left side and without treatment, they said he would be completely paralyzed within 30 minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>Mason underwent a procedure called mechanical thrombectomy. Dr. Sauvageau threaded a device called a stent retriever (a catheter with a small mesh basket) through the groin and up the main artery to the brain. The clot was captured and removed, restoring blood flow.</p><p>&ldquo;Because we pulled it out in time, he regained the ability to move everything,&rdquo; Dr. Sauvageau said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt he would have been fully paralyzed on his left side and severely disabled had he gone much longer without treatment.&rdquo;</p><p>After two days in the <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/programs-services/hospital-services/criticalcare/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Pediatric Intensive Care Unit</a>, Mason went home. He&rsquo;s on blood thinners until the last of the original clot in his heart dissolves, and he&rsquo;s working with a physical therapist to strengthen some slight weakness in his left hand. But it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before he&rsquo;ll be out on the court dribbling a basketball.</p><p>While stroke in children is not as common as it is in adults, the advantage of having two Baptist Health endovascular neurosurgeons working alongside the pediatric neurosurgery team at the Stys Neuroscience Institute at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s increases both survival and successful outcomes for kids like Mason.</p><p>&ldquo;Having such a specialized team here that&rsquo;s available for both children and adults in our region is truly significant, and we are saving lives,&rdquo; said <a href=\"http://hscj.ufl.edu/medicine/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Florida College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville&nbsp;</a>pediatric neurosurgeon, <a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-neurosurgeon/dr-philipp-aldana-md\" target=\"_blank\">Philipp Aldana, MD</a>, who is co-medical director of the Stys Neuroscience Institute and medical director of the <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/programs-services/hospital-services/neurosurgery/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Lucy Gooding Neurosurgery Center&nbsp;</a>at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Jordan has a remarkable story,&rdquo; Jackson-Chambliss said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just so thankful to everyone.&rdquo;</p>",

Pinson was diagnosed at age 10 with a rare cancer of the bones and connective tissues called Ewing&rsquo;s Sarcoma, which resulted in seemingly endless treatments.</p><p>Each underwent several rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, and relapses that eventually required a peripheral blood stem cell transplant for Lewis and a bone marrow transplant for Pinson. Both treated at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s, the two women have been in remission for about a decade.</p><p>They say they&rsquo;re thankful and inspired by their own journeys and grateful to those who took such great care of them. So it&rsquo;s no wonder that Lewis and Pinson felt called to a career that led them right back to the place where they&rsquo;d met their battles for survival head on.</p><p>Today, they&rsquo;re putting those experiences to good use by working with children who are living with the life-altering diagnosis of cancer.</p><p>&ldquo;My cancer story will always play a major part of who I am as a person, but it&rsquo;s also the reason that I chose the career that I did,&rdquo; Lewis said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a certain strength and hope I find in each patient I care for, and I feel a connection to them that I don&rsquo;t think others can experience.</p><p>&ldquo;With that, I hope to inspire families and become a source of comfort and light during their challenging times.&rdquo;</p><p>Pinson agreed wholeheartedly.</p><p>&ldquo;When I was going through treatment, I always thought about this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Today, I am happier than I have ever been in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>Christopher Noll, BSN, RN, NE-BC, nurse manager of the pediatric oncology unit, hired both young women, and says it&rsquo;s heartwarming to watch them give the same compassionate care they received.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really wonderful when someone comes into health care with a compelling personal experience, and many members of my staff have stories about how cancer impacted their lives,&rdquo; Noll said. &ldquo;These two not only have compelling stories, but what they experienced happened right here at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s been a blessing to have them here, and to see them both doing so well.&rdquo;</p><p>One of their oncologists more than a decade ago, <a href=\"http://bhwebapps.bmcjax.com/wolfsonfap/profile.aspx?id=974\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Sandler MD</a>, chief of the Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at <a href=\"https://www.nemours.org/locations/specialty-care/florida-pediatric-specialty-care-jacksonville.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville</a>, is thrilled to see them not only thriving, but serving in roles that allow them to use their first-hand knowledge of childhood cancer in a very meaningful way.</p><p>&ldquo;Children with cancer certainly endure an awful lot that that they should not have to,&rdquo; Dr. Sandler said. &ldquo;It is always a pleasure to see our former patients as healthy survivors, but seeing them now wanting to give back and help the next generation of patients, well, that is inspiring to our entire team. We are so proud of both of them.&rdquo;</p><p>These two ambassadors of hope are now spreading a message they want all of their patients to hear: When hope comes from hardship, the battle is already being won.</p><p>&ldquo;A positive attitude goes a long way when we&rsquo;re facing troubles in life,&rdquo; Pinson said. &ldquo;The most important thing I can tell a child who is going through this disease is to always have hope, and keep your head held high!&rdquo;</p>",

Julie Avirett, MM, MT-BC, a board-certified music therapist came to visit with a sweet smile and her guitar, and turned the room into a mini-recording studio.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve written a special song for Hazel,&rdquo; said Avirett, strumming her guitar. &ldquo;Sweet little Hazel, came into this world early, weighing just shy of 2 pounds, sweet little miracle, sweet little miracle,&rdquo; she sang.</p><p>&ldquo;She is my little miracle with all the stuff she&rsquo;s been through,&rdquo; Perry said.</p><p>The visit from Avirett was not only a welcome distraction, but therapy for her little daughter. Using a special piece of technology called a digital stethoscope, Avirett gently recorded Hazel&rsquo;s heartbeat and used a program called GarageBand to digitally mix it with the track she had just been singing &ndash; all at Hazel&rsquo;s bedside.</p><p>Avirett played the recording for Perry, and there, sure enough, you could hear Hazel&rsquo;s little heartbeat ticking along in rhythm.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very thankful for this,&rdquo; said Perry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play it for her when she gets older and tell her where it came from.&rdquo;</p><p>It has been a stressful few months for Perry since Hazel, now 4 months old, was transferred to <a href=\"http://wolfsonchildrens.org/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital&nbsp;</a>in December from a hospital in Pensacola, with complications related to her premature birth at 27 weeks.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been getting through it, but it&rsquo;s been a crazy time,&rdquo; Perry said.</p><p>Patients like Hazel benefit from the special therapy that music provides.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Rolling and looping through the sky as a passenger in a single-engine plane was the spark that ignited Terry Kelly&rsquo;s passion for flying, and he made a career of it.</p><p>Fast forward 35 years later and his dream job as a corporate pilot was in jeopardy.</p><p>It started with Kelly&rsquo;s boss, who was concerned about his weight, which had climbed well past 300 pounds. So he made Kelly a wager: If the pilot could lose 100 pounds, he would give him $10,000. &ldquo;He was concerned about my health and didn&rsquo;t want to lose me,&rdquo; Kelly recalled.</p><div class=\"u-size4of4 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1534987929/Juice/BAR_31275_Bariatric_Surgery_Infographic_v04.jpg\" alt=\"If you've tried everything, bariatric surgery may be a viable option. It could save your life.\"></div><p>Then things became real. An annual physical &ndash; a requirement for pilots &ndash; showed Kelly was in the beginning stage of diabetes. &ldquo;Diabetes can be a death sentence for a pilot&rsquo;s career. I was scared. This is a job I love and it&rsquo;s how I support my family,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Kelly had always been active and athletic. Motocross racing, body-building, competitive running, cycling, and tennis are just a few of his favorites. As he got older, he got heavier and it became increasingly difficult to do the things he loved.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d get up in the morning and pop three pain relievers, and then three more at night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My joints were killing me.&rdquo; He also developed sleep apnea and had to start using a C-PAP machine.</p><p>Like many heavy people, Kelly&rsquo;s weight had been a rollercoaster most of his adult life. &ldquo;I would lose 100 pounds, then gain it back; lose it again and gain it back.&rdquo;</p><p>After 10 years of not being able to budge the scale and hitting 355 pounds, Kelly started looking at alternatives. &ldquo;A good friend had bariatric surgery and lost 150 pounds. So I started reading everything I could and talking to people who had it.&rdquo;</p><p>The pounds were taking a toll on more than just his health; the weight was affecting his confidence, too. &ldquo;A lot of pilots have that Tom Cruise look &ndash; very physically fit &ndash; and here I am in my uniform at 350 pounds and the other guys are probably thinking, &lsquo;Wow, that guy&rsquo;s a pilot?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t feel that way anymore. After having weight loss surgery at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/bariatric-surgery\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Center for Bariatric Surgery</a> in May 2016, he&rsquo;s lost more than 100 pounds and scored the 10 grand from his boss. He&rsquo;s spreading the word to others and is a regular speaker at Weight Loss Surgery seminars that Baptist holds twice a month.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought having the surgery would be admitting failure,&rdquo; said Kelly. &ldquo;I had to let that go. I realized that continuing to live my life at 350 pounds was more of a risk than having the surgery.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/general-surgeon/dr-craig-morgenthal-md\">Craig Morgenthal, MD</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/general-surgeon/dr-steven-hodgett-md\">Steven Hodgett, MD</a>, at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/bariatric-surgery\">Baptist Bariatrics</a>, perform three types of weight loss surgery &ndash; gastric banding, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, which is what Kelly had. With this procedure, stomach size is reduced by about 80 percent, leaving a banana-shaped sleeve. The portion of the stomach producing the hormone that causes feelings of hunger is removed.</p><p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that life after surgery is easy. &ldquo;Surgery is a tool that helps you lose weight &ndash; but you have to do your part with nutrition and exercise,&rdquo; Kelly said. Food portions can only be four to six ounces at a time, and getting protein and nutrients has to be a priority.</p><p>Kelly said he&rsquo;s more self-confident now and feels much better. Gone are the days of taking six pain relievers and sleeping with the C-PAP machine. The best part is that he&rsquo;s no longer considered pre-diabetic, so his pilot&rsquo;s license is no longer in jeopardy.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish I would&rsquo;ve done this 10 years ago,&rdquo; he said. His success has spurred others to move forward with bariatric surgery. His mother recently had the surgery and his sister is planning to as well.</p>",

Timely action and access to a primary stroke center can pave the way for recovery. What&rsquo;s keeping the other 80 percent from seeking care promptly?</p><p>An entire 24-hour stroke team at Baptist Health thinks about that question. &nbsp;Some lose sleep over the answers. They have spent years preparing to care for stroke patients in the fastest and most effective ways. The time it takes them to move you from the door of the Emergency Room to the treatment that&rsquo;s right for you is record-breaking.</p><p><strong>They want you to know one thing: Get here. Fast.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had people tell me that they thought the symptoms would go away if they could just lay down for a few hours,&rdquo; says <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/ancillary-neurocritical-care-provider/wendy-camp\" target=\"_blank\">Wendy Camp, ARNP</a> and director of the stroke program at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/lyerly-neurosurgery\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health</a>.

Don&rsquo;t attempt to drive yourself to the hospital. If you, a family member or friend is having a stroke Camp says your best bet is to call 911.</p><p><strong>Signs of a stroke:</strong></p><ul><li>Balance is off, dizziness, nausea.</li><li>Eyesight changes in one or both eyes.</li><li>Face droops on one side.</li><li>Arm drifts downward when raised.</li><li>Speech is slurred.</li><li>Time is critical: Call 911 immediately.</li></ul><p>A stroke is a brain attack. It requires immediate action &ndash; just like a heart attack. Similar to a heart attack, it can have symptoms that are not the classic sharp pain or &ldquo;elephant sitting on the chest.&rdquo; If a stroke is suspected, the best thing you can do is call 911 immediately.</p><p><strong>What happens at Baptist Health when you call 911?</strong></p><ul><li>EMS personnel assess you and do a pre-notification call to Baptist Health&rsquo;s stroke team. Between 15 &ndash; 20 medical professionals are alerted to the fact that you&rsquo;ve had a stroke and you&rsquo;re on your way.</li><li>Baptist Health stroke team members are ready to meet you at the door and take you directly to a CT scan machine in the Emergency Room.</li><li>The CT scan can show what areas (if any) of the brain have been affected by a stroke (either a blockage or a bleeding stroke). It also shows what areas are in the clear and can be saved with quick intervention, including areas that control your speech and movement.</li><li>If the stroke is caused by the blockage of an artery, the stroke team will determine whether you can benefit from tPA (an IV medication designed to break up the clot), a mechanical thrombectomy (a minimally invasive procedure to remove the clot), or both.</li><li>If you are within the appropriate time window for tPA, and you don&rsquo;t have any contraindications to the medication (reasons to not use the medication, as it would pose greater risk than benefit), tPA will be administered once the CT scan confirms there is no evidence of bleeding in the brain.</li><li>If you would benefit from a thrombectomy, the stroke team will rapidly prepare you for the procedure and escort you to the procedure area, where a neuro endovascular specialist (a neurologist or neurosurgeon with special training) will perform the procedure. &nbsp;Many patients receive both forms of treatment.</li><li>After treatment, you will recover in the neuro post-anesthesia care unit or the neuro intensive care unit. &nbsp;It is possible to preserve most of your brain functions with quick action from you or your family, along with the rapid assessment and treatment by the stroke team at Baptist Health.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was possible.&rdquo;</p><p>Life-changing interventions are allowing people to resume their lives and to recover successfully from stroke.

But a small mole on her temple, which she had since high school, had suddenly turned darker and bigger, and it was beginning to itch.</p><p>Golden went to the dermatologist to have the mole checked out, never imagining that she would be diagnosed with Stage III melanoma, with the cancer already spreading to one lymph node.</p><p>She needed surgery to remove the mole, but doctors didn&rsquo;t want to operate while she was pregnant. So, in Golden&rsquo;s 38th week, they performed a C-section and her daughter, Greta, came into the world.</p><p>One week later, Golden was off to surgery to remove the mole, six lymph nodes (as a precaution) and a piece of her salivary gland. She would also need facial reconstruction and four months of targeted immunotherapy at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center.</a></p><p>Golden said she received overwhelming support from nurses and volunteers, who hugged her and asked about her baby as they scheduled her various appointments.</p><p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t feel like a hospital,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When an appointment like that is made for you, you just want to crawl into a hole, but it was so warm. Because of that warmth, you just take a deep breath and push through. You know the nurses when you go and it&rsquo;s the same volunteers who bring you a sandwich and smile and pray for you and ask how you are doing.</p><p>&ldquo;At the PET scan and MRI, they were so patient and kind,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;They cover you with a blanket and almost tuck you in. It&rsquo;s all just so caring. It just feels like your family is there. You&rsquo;ve never met these people, but you want to hug them when you leave.&rdquo;</p><p>At a fundraiser for Baptist MD Anderson, Golden and her husband, Jeff, a tennis pro in St. Augustine, walked hand in hand and mingled with the crowd. You would never know the battle they had faced and what lies ahead.</p><p>When Golden went into the hospital, an army of support rallied behind the couple at their home in Mandarin. Her mom and mother-in-law were there to help with the baby while church members and tennis friends brought meals for six weeks.</p><p>After the surgery, treatments have become the new normal. Golden finished her initial treatment in June 2016, but continues to receive 90-minute infusions every three months.</p><p>Golden said Greta has been such a good baby, as if the infant knew what her mom needed.</p><p>&ldquo;To have so many unknowns and to go home and snuggle a beautiful, peaceful baby, God knows our needs and he knows what we are capable of handling and he got us through and placed us in very credible hands at Baptist MD Anderson,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Through all of her treatments and after her maternity leave, Golden went back to her job as a rental coordinator for a heavy equipment dealer. When she&rsquo;s home, she&rsquo;s loving on Greta and enjoying her little family.</p><p>&ldquo;She has way too much personality,&rdquo; she said of her daughter. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just fun. You can put her in the middle of the floor and she just laughs and makes noises.</p><p>&ldquo;She came home from the hospital sleeping and she has spoiled us in every aspect of being a good baby.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>A dinner out with a friend. A road trip to Orlando. An uninterrupted night&rsquo;s sleep and living pain free. This is Lisa Mitchell&rsquo;s new normal.</p><p>For more than two years, the 46-year-old suffered from severe pain in her pelvis and back because of a nonfunctioning bladder. Sometimes she would go to the bathroom 60 times in 24 hours and up to 32 times a night. At work, she would get up from her desk&mdash;at times every 15 minutes&mdash;to use the bathroom. Travelling for her sales job became impossible.</p><p>Mitchell often lived with catheters to help empty her bladder and would wear loose clothes or long dresses to hide the bag attached to her leg. Biopsies of her bladder turned up no cancer. Medications and therapies didn&rsquo;t help. She was hospitalized when her kidneys started to fail. Mitchell&rsquo;s doctors were running out of options.</p><p>She was ultimately diagnosed with follicular cystitis, or FC, a rare and non-specific inflammatory disease of the bladder, and inflammatory pseudotumor of the bladder, which is a rare, benign condition of multiple lesions.</p><p>&ldquo;The pain was overwhelming in my pelvis and sometimes it would shoot through my back,&rdquo; said Mitchell , who lives in Mandarin. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have control of your life. You can&rsquo;t sit through a movie or go to the mall. You can&rsquo;t do anything. It controls you.&rdquo;</p><p>She found a solution in January after her urologist connected her with <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/urologist/dr-seth-strope-md\">Seth Strope, MD</a>, urologic oncologist surgeon and head of urologic oncology at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center.</a></p><p>After trying some additional treatments with no success, Mitchell opted to have her bladder removed and a new one made out of a portion of her small intestines.</p><p>&ldquo;Inflammatory pseudotumor looks like sarcoma, but it&rsquo;s not malignant. It&rsquo;s also not normal and she wasn&rsquo;t recovering,&rdquo; said Dr. Strope, who performed the surgery April 6 at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>. &ldquo;We tried to treat conservatively to see if we could preserve her renal function. But despite efforts to relax her bladder and help her bladder function, it was progressively getting worse so she choose to undergo surgery.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Strope, assisted by Mitchell&rsquo;s urologist <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/urologist/dr-charles-cobb-md\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Cobb, MD</a>, removed her bladder, using robotic-assisted surgery and making small incisions that spared her reproductive organs. From about a foot of her small intestine, Dr. Strope constructed a pouch and placed it back in the same position as her original bladder.</p><p>The new bladder, called a &ldquo;neobladder&rdquo; was attached to her ureters, the tubes that carry urine produced by the kidneys.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s doing very well,&rdquo; Dr. Strope said. &ldquo;Now she can sleep through the night. Her quality of life is better.&rdquo;</p><p>All the pain and inconvenience she endured was worth it in the end, Mitchell said.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted something as natural as possible and to be able to leave my other organs in place. I was all for it. I just wanted something to help me,&rdquo; Mitchell said.</p><p>She is grateful to Dr. Strope and Dr. Cobb.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big miracle,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even begin to tell you how happy I am. I can do things I have not been able to do for a long time. I only get up once or twice a night. It&rsquo;s the difference between night and day.&rdquo;</p><p>Mitchell said she&rsquo;s back to working out at the gym for the first time in three years. She is out enjoying friends and going on long rides to Orlando and Savannah.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy to go out and enjoy myself,&rdquo; Mitchell said. &ldquo;Just like that, I feel normal again.&rdquo;</p><p>While not every bladder problem is as extreme as Lisa&rsquo;s, frequent urination, pelvic pain and incontinence are very common issues among women of all ages. That&rsquo;s why, in addition to offering advanced surgical options, Baptist Health also offers unique wellness resources for women through its <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/4her-center-for-women\">4her Center for Women&nbsp;</a>&ndash; including the Total Control&reg; pelvic health and wellness program.

He likens the medical portion of the combine to scenes from a &ldquo;Roman theater,&rdquo; as bare-chested warriors are poked, pulled and prodded by a swarm of orthopedic specialists.</p><p>&ldquo;When a high draft pick enters the room, a silence seems to come over it and a tight circle of physicians form around the exam table,&rdquo; added Dr. Rodriquez, also the chief radiologist for the Jacksonville Sharks and the Jacksonville Armada. &ldquo;While the players are getting their physicals, I&rsquo;m viewing their MRIs on a computer screen to see if they have any issues that the team docs need to know about.&rdquo;</p><p>Unlike the secrecy surrounding the annual NFL draft, all 32 NFL teams share their findings on every player at the combine, including the results of more than 500 MRIs that are ordered that week.</p><div class=\"u-size1of2 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/v1522266430/Juice/NFL_combine2.jpg\" alt=\"Radiologists work the NFL Combine\"></div><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say, 500 is a conservative estimate,&rdquo; said Dr. Rodriguez, who works alongside two <a href=\"http://www.joionline.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute</a> surgeons at the combine, Steven Crenshaw, MD, and <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/orthopedic-surgeon/dr-kevin-kaplan-md\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Kaplan, MD</a>, the head team physician for the Jaguars. &ldquo;We want to evaluate every injury these guys may have had, down to their Pop Warner playing days.&rdquo;</p><p>Due to the severe injuries that football players sustain, veteran radiologists like Rodriguez, who spends a week of his annual vacation time working the combine, have to adjust their baseline for what is normal. &ldquo;At the combine, we&rsquo;re looking at specific things such as worn or missing cartilage and surgical grafts when interpreting the MRIs in order to predict the professional longevity of these players,&rdquo; added the Jacksonville native and the son of Frank Rodriguez, MD, a founding member of the emergency medicine group at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m basically a radiologist on retainer for the Jaguars. They can always reach me, 24-7, because I tend to monitor my computer network so I can read all their scans live while they&rsquo;re being done in Jacksonville. A few years ago, I spent five hours reading MRIs from a Jaguars preseason game while I was on my wedding anniversary in Prague.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Rodriguez began his medical training in surgery but chose to specialize in musculoskeletal radiology after completing a residency at the renowned Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p><p>&ldquo;I could not imagine doing my job without a skilled radiologist like Dr. Rodriguez,&rdquo; said Dr. Kaplan, who has served as the Jaguars head team physician for the past eight years. &ldquo;Dr. Rodriguez is an invaluable member of the team&#39;s medical staff, both at the combine and during the regular season.&rdquo;</p><p>Added Dr. Rodriguez: &ldquo;Radiologists are integral to patient care. Physicians value our opinions and rely on our diagnosis. We are an essential cog in the wheel.&rdquo;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>As a Yale University undergrad, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/general-surgeon/dr-beth-lesnikoski-md\">Beth-Ann Lesnikoski</a>, MD, chose architecture as her major, but her heart was always pulling her toward medical school. Her dad was a pharmacist and scrub tech in the U.S. Army. Her mom was an OR nurse whose four sisters were also nurses.</p><p>At Temple University School of Medicine, Dr. Lesnikoski thought she&rsquo;d be a pediatrician. But then came a rotation that included breast surgery, followed by a mid-1990s clinical fellowship on diseases of the breast at the Faulkner Breast Centre in Boston. It was one of the first of only three breast fellowships in the U.S.</p><p>&ldquo;I felt like I plugged into an electrical socket. It was just right and I have felt that way ever since,&rdquo; she recalled.</p><p>Now 55 and a breast surgeon for 20 years, Dr. Lesnikoski brings that same passion to her position as the new director of the breast program at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\">Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center.</a></p><p>&quot;Helping breast cancer patients goes far beyond the operating room,&quot; she said. &quot;The relationships are long term.&quot;</p><p>&ldquo;With breast surgery, you really get to know people and you take them from their darkest days to really some of their brightest days,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Breast cancer is very curable. Most patients will survive and thrive. It&rsquo;s really great to see people come around to that other side. That&rsquo;s one of the most gratifying things.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Keeping patients close</strong></p><p>At Baptist MD Anderson, Dr. Lesnikoski will oversee a program of comprehensive breast health and cancer treatment in the community, so patients are close to their families and support networks.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about taking a tumor out,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so much more than that to get someone to feel whole and happy and healthy again, like they&rsquo;ve conquered the world.&quot;</p><p>&ldquo;We need to model our programs with a variety of options for patients,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;There is no one size fits all. We are learning how to give less radiation and still be effective and we are learning how to use immunotherapy in addition to chemotherapy or sometimes instead of chemotherapy.&rdquo;</p><p>Developing breast health programs has been at the center of Dr. Lesnikoski&rsquo;s career. &nbsp;For the past eight years, she has served as founding medical director of The Breast Institute at JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, Fla.</p><p>Previously, she was the founding medical director at South Shore Hospital Breast Care Center in Massachusetts. Dr. Lesnikoski helped develop a joint cancer center between South Shore, Dana- Farber Cancer Institute and the Brigham &amp; Women&rsquo;s Hospital. She was an attending breast surgeon for 10 years at both Dana-Farber and Brigham, and at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for five years.</p><p>Before moving to Florida in 2009, she spent 20 years as an instructor at Harvard Medical School. Nationally, she also is a surveyor for the Commission on Cancer and the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers.</p><p>As a surgeon, Dr. Lesnikoski uses techniques similar to those of plastic surgeons when performing a lumpectomy or other procedures to restore the natural appearance of the breast.</p><p>Oncoplastic surgery combines the latest plastic surgery techniques with breast surgical oncology.</p><p>&ldquo;There is a lot of artistry that appeals to the side of me that was attracted to architecture,&rdquo; she said, adding that she still dabbles in architecture by doing interior design and structural work on houses she has owned.</p><p><strong>Family history</strong></p><p>Dr. Lesnikoski&rsquo;s passion for cancer awareness started with her parents, who were active in church and school events. Her father, who died from melanoma, was a longtime volunteer and leader in the American Cancer Society. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Becoming involved with the American Cancer Society was a natural fit for me to carry on his legacy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He became involved after my aunt died of cancer at 42. She was the first of 17 of my relatives who have had cancer. I&#39;ve lost three cousins in their 40s to the disease, as well as aunts and uncles.&rdquo;</p><p>When she&rsquo;s not in the operating room or serving on various state and national cancer committees, she&rsquo;s listening to her husband, a Grammy-nominated musician, and cycling several times a week.</p><p>Dr. Lesnikoski has cycled in many charitable events, including a solo, 65-day cross-country ride that raised money for a cancer support group. In May, she participated in the American Cancer Society&rsquo;s four-day Florida Hope Ride from Tampa to Jacksonville.</p><p>&ldquo;Many people aren&#39;t aware that maintaining a healthy weight, diet and exercise regimen can reduce the risk of getting cancer and improve the odds of survival for those affected,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp; &ldquo;Long-distance charity rides combine my love of the outdoors and cycling with my passion to raise awareness and end this deadly disease.&rdquo;</p><p><br></p><p><em>For information on Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center go to&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://baptistmdanderson.com\"><em>baptistmdanderson.com</em></a><em>&nbsp;or call 1.844.632.2278.

In 2013, she was diagnosed with a rare cerebrovascular disorder and had brain surgery.

She always has a smile on her face as she welcomes, and comforts, the families of critically ill children, along with her co-workers.</p><p>Even when Bell faced her own health crisis in 2007, a diagnosis of breast cancer, she barely faltered. &nbsp;&ldquo;You hear the word cancer, and it takes you to another place,&rdquo; she explained, allowing her always present smile to fade for the briefest of moments. &ldquo;I fell down, but I got back up again.&rdquo; Bell said.</p><p>After her diagnosis, it would have been easy to understand if she needed to take some time away from work. But Bell refused to take even one day, scheduling her appointments&mdash;chemotherapy and radiation&mdash;on Fridays, her days off, so she could have the weekend to recover. That way, she could be there on Monday morning, greeting and supporting families and staff coming in and out of the PICU.</p><p>Now 10 years cancer-free, Bell continues to support families through their own health crises on the PICU. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the calm in the chaos, the mama bear to the entire floor,&rdquo; said Hidi Moody, RN, who has worked with Bell for the past seven years. Bell and her co-workers agree that the PICU can be one of the most challenging departments for anyone in the health care profession due to the nature of the medical conditions these critically ill children face, and the circumstances in which they face them.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The darkest days are always when we lose a child,&rdquo; said Bell. &ldquo;You never get comfortable with that, and I don&rsquo;t think there is a way to cope. I just put it in a different place and pray, every morning, to be the light in someone else&rsquo;s life that day. That&rsquo;s the only way you can keep going.&rdquo;</p><p>Bell and her co-workers see tragedy, but they also see triumph. A once-sick child is made well, broken bones heal and everyone celebrates the day the patient is discharged from the care of the PICU staff.</p><p>After more than three decades of service to the families and patients in the Wolfson Children&rsquo;s PICU, Bell has no plans of stopping anytime in the near future. &ldquo;Karen is such a strong woman, when things get hectic or hard, which is bound to happen, her calm and tender nature helps everyone on this floor,&rdquo; Moody explained. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what we would do without her.&rdquo;</p><p>The feeling is mutual. &ldquo;My co-workers do not even realize how much strength they give me, how much they inspire me,&rdquo; said Bell. &ldquo;They help me to stay focused and to keep that positive outlook.&rdquo;</p>",

But too often, they leave out one big lifestyle change.&nbsp;</p><p>That adulthood &ldquo;frenemy&quot; some may resort to after a long workday to take the edge off &mdash; a glass of wine, or two, or perhaps a cold beer. &nbsp;</p><p>About 70 percent of Americans don&#39;t recognize that drinking alcohol is a risk factor for cancer, according to the National Cancer Opinion Survey by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But now, for the first time, ASCO has linked alcohol use &mdash; light, moderate or heavy &mdash; with increased risk for several common cancers, including those of the breast, colon, esophagus, and head and neck.&nbsp;</p><p>The Society reported 5.5 percent of all new cancers and 5.8 percent of all cancer deaths worldwide can be attributed to alcohol use.</p><p>&ldquo;People often underestimate the amount they are drinking,&quot; said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/hematologist-oncologist/dr-amanda-shreders-md\" target=\"_blank\">Amanda Shreders, MD</a>, a hematologist/oncologist with B<a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/baptist-md-anderson-cancer-center\" target=\"_blank\">aptist MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>. &ldquo;This announcement by ASCO may bring alcohol into more conversations, and maybe having this awareness will inspire people to be more informed about what they put into their bodies.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, to be absolutely safe, the recommendation would seem to be to stop drinking entirely, Dr. Shreders said. But, oncologists aren&#39;t going that far. Instead, the group suggests that if you want to lower your cancer risk, reduce your alcohol intake.&nbsp;</p><p>Drinking, which affects all races, ages and income levels, is on the rise in the United States, and binge drinking has become the most common, deadly pattern of excessive alcohol abuse, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &nbsp;</p><p>In fact, one in six adults binge drinks about four times a month, consuming about eight drinks per binge.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Shreders said when she asks patients about their drinking, they often tell her, &ldquo;Oh, I just drink socially.&quot; But, she struggles to quantify such a statement.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We need to make it so that physicians are not afraid to ask how much alcohol a patient drinks, and patients shouldn&#39;t be intimidated by the question,&quot; she added. &ldquo;We want to make sure we get the best care possible for our patients.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>People tend to think alcohol is only linked to liver cancer, Dr. Shreders said, but that&#39;s just not true.</p><p>Women who drink moderately &mdash; just one drink daily &mdash; can increase breast cancer risk, and nearly double the risk for mouth and throat cancer. Alcohol was also determined to be a probable cause of increased liver cancer and colorectal cancer in women. But what is one drink exactly? According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, one &quot;standard&quot; drink contains roughly 14 grams of pure alcohol, which is found in:</p><div class=\"u-size1of2 u-floatLeft u-spaceRight05 u-padRight06\"><img class=\"u-block u-sizeFull fr-dii fr-draggable\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/baptisthealth/image/upload/c_scale,h_1755,q_80/v1521469744/Juice/Cancer_Alcohol_-_secondary_2.jpg\" alt=\"drink infographic\"></div><p>Red wine should not be considered an exception. There is no clear evidence that drinking red wine contributes to good health, clinical oncologists say.</p><p>Heavy drinkers, women who consume more than seven drinks a week or men who consume more than 14 a week, see their risk increase dramatically. For throat and mouth cancers, the risk is more than five times higher for heavy drinkers than it is for non-drinkers. Heavy drinkers also have double the risk of liver cancer than non-drinkers.&nbsp;</p><p>Research is still being developed to determine whether or not those who stop drinking see benefits from the lifestyle change. However, Dr. Shreders said analysis indicates former drinkers do see a decline in their risk, particularly for head and neck cancers.&nbsp;</p><p>The relationship between cancer and alcohol appears to be dependent on the amount a person consumes, which means risk increases as consumption increases, she added.</p><p>People need to recognize how much they are actually drinking.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;A primary care doctor is a great resource to help you understand what is considered heavy use,&quot; Dr. Shreders said. &quot;They can also help identify resources or strategies for reducing intake.

They attended weekly classes in anatomy and physiology, medical terminology, microbiology, pharmacology at Florida State College of Jacksonville.</p><p>Bryant started her Baptist career as a health unit coordinator in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital. In 2013, she was one of 27 team members who graduated from Baptist&rsquo;s first training program for certified nursing assistants (CNA). Since then, she&rsquo;s worked as both a CNA and a milk tech in the NICU and as a CNA in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Not bad for someone whose heart once raced at the mere mention of medicine.</p><p>&ldquo;I was scared to death to work in a hospital. But less than six months into it, I knew patient care was where I wanted to be,&rdquo; said Bryant, adding that nursing school is now &ldquo;in the back of her mind.&rdquo;</p><p>Like Bryant, Jennifer Edusei spent four years as a CNA at <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>. Before that, she worked in food and nutrition at the Jacksonville hospital. &ldquo;She was ringing me up at the register when I said, &lsquo;You are so friendly. You would make an awesome CNA,&rsquo; &rdquo; recalled Shannon Baum, director of the Baptist Flex Team, a pool of patient care providers who agree to work anywhere in the health system.</p><p>Edusei, a single mother of three, paid Baum forward by recruiting Environmental Services technician and former dietary worker Chad Castor to the surgery tech program. &ldquo;I was actually the first one to interview,&rdquo; added Castor, a former college football player known for forcing fumbles on defense. &ldquo;I like the teamwork aspect of surgery and the intensity of it. It reminds me of my playing days.&rdquo;</p><p>Sabrina King, who works as a senior materials handler in the supply chain department at Baptist Jacksonville, had visions of going to a private college to become a surgery tech.

In fact, the couple&rsquo;s circa 1938 brick home is situated in Evacuation Zone A, considered one of the area&rsquo;s most vulnerable to flooding.</p><p>&ldquo;They had 3 feet of water in their house, which damaged all their walls and wood floors. They also lost all their appliances,&rdquo; said Sharon Glenn, the couple&rsquo;s case manager and life coach. &ldquo;Alvin always wished he had flood insurance, but because he&rsquo;s on a fixed income he could never afford it.&rdquo;</p><p>After Irma rendered their home uninhabitable, the couple stayed in a shelter or in temporary housing provided by FEMA. A portable storage container with all their salvageable belongings was parked on their front yard for months.</p><p>&ldquo;When Alvin first saw the water damage, he didn&rsquo;t want to live there anymore,&rdquo; Glenn said. &ldquo;But now the house looks even better than it did before the hurricane.&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s because a handful of local businesses donated more than $80,000 in repairs and furnishings to the couple&#39;s home, including new tile, wood flooring, and extensive mold treatments. The Pittmans have also received financial assistance from their church and Florida&rsquo;s First Coast Relief Fund, a collaboration of Northeast Florida&rsquo;s largest nonprofit funders, including <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health,</a> to aid citizens affected by the hurricane.</p><p>&ldquo;The First Coast Relief Fund paid their electric bills and to fix one of their air-conditioning units. They also gave Virginia gift cards to a department store because she lost some of her personal items, including her purse, which she left on the floor of a closet,&rdquo; said Glenn, adding that FEMA also agreed to take care of the Pittmans flood insurance payments through November 2020.</p><p>Alvin is retired from <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-jacksonville\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville</a>, where he worked as a housekeeper for more than 30 years. Virginia spent more than 30 years as a dishwasher. The couple first met at a special-education class in Riverside while they were living in group homes. Virginia grew up in foster care and Alvin spent time in a boys home. They&rsquo;ve been married since 1981 and still attend the same church where they tied the knot &mdash; Southside United Methodist on Hendricks Avenue.</p><p>&ldquo;Virginia is into crocheting and Johnny Depp movies and Alvin likes to watch westerns and sports,&rdquo; said Glenn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working with them since 2012, and we had just gotten their place renovated before the hurricane came.

The Florida Chapter of the <a href=\"http://www.wolfsonchildrens.com\">American Academy of Pediatric</a>s (FCAAP) recently hosted a program, The Future of Pediatric Practice Regional Glances, in Jacksonville on sudden cardiac deaths in adolescents. The FCAAP program speakers were Jose Ettedgui, MD, medical director of the UF Health Pediatric Cardiovascular Center at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital, and Michael Shillingford, MD, chief of Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;Sudden cardiac death occurs rarely among young athletes,&rdquo; said Dr. Shillingford. &ldquo;However, when sudden cardiac death happens in a young person, it is devastating to the teen&rsquo;s family, friends, school and community.&rdquo;</p><p>The program focused on cardiology and preventing sudden cardiac death. The speakers discussed the importance of screening, treating and managing problems and preparing for the possibility of sudden cardiac death.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also vital to have automated external defibrillators (AEDs) available with the presence of experienced medical personnel in public settings. The use of an AED can lead to an improved outcome to victims of sudden cardiac death.</p><p>&ldquo;Sudden cardiac death in young athletes may be preventable,&rdquo; said Dr. Ettedgui. &ldquo;Screening can help identify at-risk individuals.&rdquo;</p><p>The congenital heart surgeons at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital have expertise in all pediatric congenital heart procedures, ranging from simple to highly complex. Whether it&rsquo;s open-heart, minimally invasive or video-assisted surgery, its board-certified cardiothoracic surgeons use the most-advanced technology and techniques to repair heart defects.</p><p>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital offers cardiology checkups, comprehensive testing and pediatric cardiology specialists at each of its specialty centers in Brunswick, Ga., Daytona Beach, Fleming Island/Clay County, Lake City and Tallahassee.&nbsp;</p><p>Wolfson Children&rsquo;s cardiothoracic surgeons know which procedure is best for each individual&rsquo;s situation and when it should be performed. The team uses advanced imaging techniques, including echocardiography, cardiac MRI and 3-D imaging, to help determine the right approach, resulting in some of the best pediatric heart surgery outcomes in the nation.</p><p>Services provided at Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital are provided primarily by pediatric physician specialists with Nemours Children&rsquo;s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, and the University of Florida College of Medicine &ndash; Jacksonville.</p>",

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>Jacksonville resident Meghan Debbie came down with COVID-19 around Easter and self-isolated in her home for nearly two months.</p><p>She received regular visits from a <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/services/home-health-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Home Health Care&nbsp;</a>nurse and daily virtual visits from both a Baptist Home Health case manager and a <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Primary Care&nbsp;</a>(BPC) physician.</p><p>&ldquo;I was ill to the point where comparing it to a bad case of the flu doesn&rsquo;t begin to describe it,&rdquo; said Debbie, a 30-year-old single mom who isn&rsquo;t sure where she contracted the novel coronavirus. &ldquo;My fever was spiking and I had shortness of breath.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when my Baptist family physician, <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/family-physician/dr-lynsey-schlotzer-md\" target=\"_blank\">Lynsey Schlotzer, MD</a>, put in an order for a Baptist Home Health nurse to come to my apartment. The nurse literally showed up at my doorstep in a matter of hours,&rdquo; Debbie added.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Actively contagious&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Lotoya Roberson, RN, arrived at Debbie&rsquo;s Bartram Park apartment and immediately checked Debbie&rsquo;s blood-oxygen saturation level, using a pulse oximeter that clipped onto her finger to measure how much oxygen her red blood cells were carrying.</p><p>A normal reading is typically between 95 and 100 percent. Debbie&rsquo;s was below normal. Roberson left a pulse oximeter with Debbie so she could check and monitor her own oxygen saturation levels overnight.</p><p>A day later, Debbie&rsquo;s oxygen saturation level had fallen even lower, so a second Baptist Home Health nurse, Lori Overstreet, BSN, consulted with Dr. Schlotzer before starting Debbie on oxygen therapy.</p><p>&ldquo;Baptist Home Health provided me with plenty of oxygen, including a portable oxygen concentrator that never ran out,&rdquo; said Debbie, a local pharmacy manager who quarantined in her bedroom while her 10-year-old son, Ryan, moved in with his grandmother.</p><p>&ldquo;My mom had to take care of him, while I was actively contagious, but we were able to stay in touch through video chats. It&rsquo;s always been just me and him, so it was hard on both of us,&rdquo; she added.</p><p><strong>Physician level of engagement</strong></p><p>Lisa Kidd, MSN, Baptist Home Health administrator, said <a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Baptist Health&nbsp;</a>patients experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 can receive enhanced home support by first calling their Baptist Primary Care (BPC) physician.</p><p>&ldquo;The majority of our patients experiencing COVID-like symptoms were referred to us from one of our more than 50 BPC offices, not from hospitalizations,&rdquo; said Kidd, who heads up a skilled team of Home Health nurses, aides, therapists and social workers.</p><p>&ldquo;Our nurses can be dispatched to the home relatively soon with a variety of resources, including kits to obtain a COVID-19 test specimen and blood samples, in addition to oxygen, and self-monitoring supplies.&rdquo;</p><p>A physician&rsquo;s order set allows the Home Health nurse to perform lab work in the home and start the patient on oxygen if needed. Baptist physicians, including hospitalists and ER physicians working with the Baptist Health, can refer patients to this new Home Health service.</p><p>Amy Caldwell, RN, a Baptist Home Health case manager, kept in constant contact with Debbie through virtual visits and text messaging.</p><p>Debbie said Caldwell was there when she needed her most, especially one day when her shortness of breath was so severe she had to increase her oxygen intake to near maximum levels.</p><p>&ldquo;I was having trouble breathing and Amy calmed me down and then got Dr. Schlotzer on the phone,&rdquo; Debbie recalled. &ldquo;They were super attentive to my care and really in touch with one another.&rdquo;</p><p>Added Dr. Schlotzer: &ldquo;Her shortness of breath was extremely alarming and persistent for three weeks. She literally had a fever of more than 100 degrees for 40 days straight.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Joint effort</strong></p><p>Debbie&rsquo;s weeks-long fever finally broke on May 25. Her body stopped aching and her dry cough started to subside. A Baptist Home Health nurse swabbed her twice for COVID-19 and both tests came back negative.</p><p>&ldquo;When her fever broke, I knew she had turned the corner and the virus was giving up,&rdquo; said Dr. Schlotzer. &ldquo;Her breathing started to improve after that.&rdquo;</p><p>Through a joint effort with Baptist Home Health and BPC, Debbie was able to be treated for COVID-19 on an outpatient basis, saving her from making multiple trips to the ER or being admitted to the hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would have made it, if it were not for Dr. Schlotzer and the Baptist Home Health nurses,&rdquo; said Debbie, who was out of work for 49 days battling COVID-19. &ldquo;The care I received from Baptist was unparalleled.&rdquo;</p><p>At Baptist Health, we want to help keep our community informed about COVID-19.

    "HtmlDescription": "<p>COVID-19 may be at the top of everyone&rsquo;s minds, but even a global pandemic can&rsquo;t stop flu season. Every fall and winter, and sometimes even into spring, the influenza virus is more active than usual, and our doctors start asking us to get our flu shot. This year, it&rsquo;s vital that we listen.</p><p>The Duval County Medical Society Foundation (DCMS Foundation) &mdash; in partnership with local hospitals/health systems, pharmacies and other organizations &mdash; launched the <a href=\"https://www.dcmsonline.org/page/fluvaxjax\" target=\"_blank\">#FluVaxJax campaign</a> with the goal of increasing the rate of influenza vaccinations on the First Coast. Last year, only 36.9% of residents in the five-county region got their flu shot. This year, Baptist Health and Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital are joining the #FluVaxJax campaign to raise that number.</p><p>&ldquo;We always want to emphasize the importance of flu vaccines to our community,&rdquo; says <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=000447018956802487534:WMX1266190585&q=https://www.baptistjax.com/about-us/administration/liz-ransom&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjas5OLj4frAhVRLKwKHQSMDP0QFjAAegQIAhAB&usg=AOvVaw1pEfju62dKm5nll2jhOuL5\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Ransom, MD, FACS,</a> executive vice president and chief physician executive at Baptist Health. &ldquo;This year, it&rsquo;s more critical than ever. With COVID in our communities and around the world, we need to limit influenza as much as possible, and the best way to do that is, of course, by vaccination. This partnership is a great opportunity to get the word out.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wolfsonchildrens.com/doctors/pediatric-infectious-disease-specialist/dr-mobeen-rathore-md\" target=\"_blank\">Mobeen Rathore, MD,</a> chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease and Immunology for Wolfson Children&rsquo;s Hospital and co-director of the Baptist Health Infection Prevention and Control Committee, agrees that flu shots are just one more way we can protect ourselves, our children and each other during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>&ldquo;The symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are quite similar, so if you are protected against flu, you will not get those symptoms that will worry you about having COVID. It&rsquo;s enough to have one problem, but you don&rsquo;t want a second,&rdquo; he explained.</p><p>Dr. Ransom added that by getting vaccinated, the community can help prevent severe flu cases and the complications that can accompany a flu infection. With hospitals already working to treat COVID patients in their ICUs, flu cases would be an additional burden on much-needed healthcare resources.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to reduce influenza as much as possible because we have a vaccine for that so we can reduce the rate of infection. We don&rsquo;t have a vaccine for COVID yet. It&rsquo;s important to get the flu vaccine for yourself, your loved ones, and those you encounter,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Fall and winter are when we start to see patients coming in with the flu and complications related to the flu. We already have a number of COVID-19 patients in our local hospitals so if we can reduce the burden of flu patients, it&rsquo;ll be a much better scenario for our health systems overall.&rdquo;</p><p>In fact, the last time the world experienced a pandemic was in 1918, when one-third of the U.S. population was infected with the flu. Today, those most at risk are children, the elderly and people with underlying conditions, such as HIV or lung disease. Even healthy adults, who may only experience the flu mildly, are encouraged to get vaccinated so they don&rsquo;t spread it to others.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends flu shots for everyone 6 months of age and older, especially children &mdash; for them, the flu can sometimes result in pneumonia and death. Dr. Rathore thinks often people opt out of the vaccine, for themselves and their children, either because of busy schedules or bad information.</p><p>&ldquo;I think one unfortunate reason people decline the flu shot is due to misinformation. There&rsquo;s a lot of anti-vaccine propaganda. The second reason is that it&rsquo;s an annual vaccine, and sometimes it&rsquo;s a convenience issue. There are misconceptions that it either isn&rsquo;t safe, it doesn&rsquo;t protect you or it can give you the flu. None of those are true.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think there are a lot of reasons for opting out, including just being busy and never getting around to it,&rdquo; Dr. Ransom added. &ldquo;Also, sometimes people have a little bit of hesitation and are fearful of getting the vaccine. That said, you can&rsquo;t get the flu from the flu vaccine. There have been millions of vaccines administered over the last 50 years, and they&rsquo;re very safe. We want to be sure everyone is aware of the facts.&rdquo;</p><p><em>To get your flu shot, make an appointment with a </em><a href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/doctors/baptist-primary-care/locations\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baptist Primary Care physician</em></a><em> or visit any Walgreens pharmacy.</em></p>",
